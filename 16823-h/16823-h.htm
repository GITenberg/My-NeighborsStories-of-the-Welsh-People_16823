<h2><a name="THE_WELSH_PEOPLE" id="THE_WELSH_PEOPLE"></a>THE WELSH PEOPLE</h2>


<p>Our God is a big man: a tall man much
higher than the highest chapel in Wales
and broader than the broadest chapel. For
the promised day that He comes to deliver
us a sermon we shall have made a hole in
the roof and taken down a wall. Our God
has a long, white beard, and he is not
unlike the Father Christmas of picture-books.
Often he lies on his stomach on
Heaven's floor, an eye at one of his myriads
of peepholes, watching that we keep
his laws. Our God wears a frock coat, a
starched linen collar and black necktie, and
a silk hat, and on the Sabbath he preaches
to the congregation of Heaven.</p>

<p>Heaven is a Welsh chapel; but its pulpit
is of gold, and its walls, pews, floor, roof,
harmonium, and its clock&mdash;which marks
the days of the month as well as the hours
of the day&mdash;are of glass. The inhabitants
are clothed in the white shirts in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<i>p</i>  4]</span>they were buried and in which they arose
at the Call; and the language of God and
his angels and of the Company of Prophets
is Welsh, that being the language spoken
in the Garden of Eden and by Jacob,
Moses, Abraham, and Elijah.</p>

<p>Wales is Heaven on earth, and every
Welsh chapel is a little Heaven; and God
has favored us greatly by choosing to rule
over us preachers who are fashioned in his
likeness and who are without spot or
blemish.</p>

<p>Every Welsh child knows that the
preacher is next to God; "I am the Big
Man's photograph," the preacher shouts;
and the child is brought up in the fear
of the preacher.</p>

<p>Jealous of his trust, the preacher has
made rules for the salvation of our bodies
and souls. Temptations such as art,
drama, dancing, and the study of folklore
he has removed from our way. Those
are vanities, which make men puffed up
and vainglorious; and they are unsavory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<i>p</i>  5]</span>in the nostrils of the Big Man. And look
you, the preacher asks, do they not cost
money? Are they not time wasters? The
capel needs your money, boys bach, that
the light&mdash;the grand, religious light&mdash;shall
shine in the pulpit.</p>

<p>That is the lamp which burns throughout
Wales. It keeps our feet from Church
door and public house, and it guides us
to the polling booth where we record our
votes as the preacher has instructed us.
Be the season never so hard and be men
and women never so hungry, its flame does
not wane and the oil in its vessel is not
low.</p>

<p>White cabbages and new potatoes, eggs
and measures of corn, milk and butter and
money we give to the preacher. We trim
our few acres until our shoulders are
crutched and the soil is in the crevices of
our flesh that his estate shall be a glory
unto God. We make for him a house
which is as a mansion set amid hovels and
for the building thereof the widow must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<i>p</i>  6]</span>set aside portions of her weekly old age
pension. These things and many more we
do, for forgiveness of sin is obtained by
sacrifice. Such folk as hold back their offerings
have their names proclaimed in the
pulpit.</p>

<p>Said the preacher: "Heavy was the punishment
of the Big Man on Twm Cwm,
persons, because Twm speeched against
the capel. Was he not put in the coffin
in his farm trowsis and jacket? And do
you know, the Big Man cast a brightness
on his buttons for him to be known in the
blackness of hell."</p>

<p>It is no miracle that we are religious.
Our God is just behind the preacher, and
he is in the semblance of the preacher; and
we believe in him truly. It is no miracle
that we are prayerful. Our God is by us
in our hagglings and cheatings. Becca
Penffos prays that the dealer's eyes are
closed to the disease of her hen; Shon
Porth asks the Big Man to destroy his
pregnant sister into whose bed Satan en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<i>p</i>  7]</span>ticed
him; Ianto Tybach says: "Give me
a nice bit of haymaking weather, God bach.
Strike my brother Enoch dead and blind
and see I have his fields without any old
bother. A champion am I in the religion
and there's gifts I give the preacher. Ask
him. That's all. Amen."</p>

<p>Although we know God, we are afraid
of to-morrow: one will steal our seeds, a
horse will perish, our wife will die and a
servant woman will have to be hired to the
time that we find another wife, the Englishman
whom we defrauded in the market
place will come and seek his rights.</p>

<p>We are what we have been made by our
preachers and politicians, and thus we remain.
Among ourselves our repute is ill.
Our villages and countryside are populated
with the children of cousins who have married
cousins and of women who have played
the harlot with their brothers; and no one
loves his neighbor. Abroad we are distrusted
and disdained. This is said of us:
"A Welshman's bond is as worthless as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<i>p</i>  8]</span>his word." We traffic in prayers and
hymns, and in the name of Jesus Christ,
and we display a spurious heart upon our
breast. Our politicians, crafty pupils of
the preachers and now their masters, weep
and moan in the public places as if they
were women in childbirth; in their souls
they are lustful and cruel and greedy.
They have made themselves the slaves of
the wicked, and like asses their eyes are
lifted no higher than the golden carrot
which is their reward from the wicked.
Not of one of us it can be said: "He is a
great man," or "He is a good man," or
"He is an honest man."</p>

<p>Maybe the living God will consider our
want of knowledge and act mercifully toward
us.</p>

<h2>LOVE AND HATE</h2>


<p>By living frugally&mdash;setting aside a portion
of his Civil Service pay and holding
all that he got from two butchers whose
trade books he kept in proper order&mdash;Adam
Powell became possessed of Cartref
in which he dwelt and which is in Barnes,
and two houses in Thornton East; and one
of the houses in Thornton East he let to
his widowed daughter Olwen, who carried
on a dressmaking business. At the end
of his term he retired from his office, his
needs being fulfilled by a pension, and
his evening eased by the ministrations of
his elder daughter Lisbeth.</p>

<p>Soon an inward malady seized him, and
in the belief that he would not be rid of it,
he called Lisbeth and Olwen, to whom
both he pronounced his will.</p>

<p>"The Thornton East property I give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<i>p</i>  12]</span>you," he said. "Number seven for Lissi
and eight for Olwen as she is. It will be
pleasant to be next door, and Lissi is not
likely to marry at her age which is advanced.
Share and share alike of the furniture,
and what's left sell with the house
and haff the proceeds. If you don't fall
out in the sharing, you never will again."</p>

<p>At once Lisbeth and Olwen embraced.</p>

<p>"My sister is my best friend," was the
testimony of the elder; "we shan't go
astray if we follow the example of the
dad and mother," was that of the younger.</p>

<p>"Take two or three excursion trains
to Aberporth for the holidays," said
Adam, "and get a little gravel for the
mother's grave in Beulah. And a cheap
artificial wreath. They last better than
real ones. It was in Beulah that me and
your mother learnt about Jesus."</p>

<p>Together Olwen and Lisbeth pledged
that they would attend their father's
behests: shunning ill-will and continually
petitioning to be translated to the King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<i>p</i>  13]</span>dom
of God; "but," Lisbeth laughed
falsely, "you are not going to die. The
summer will do wonders for you."</p>

<p>"You are as right as a top really,"
cried Olwen.</p>

<p>Beholding that his state was the main
concern of his children, Adam counted
himself blessed; knowing of a surety
that the designs of God stand fast
against prayer and physic, he said: "I
am shivery all over."</p>

<p>A fire was kindled and coals piled upon
it that it was scarce to be borne, and
three blankets were spread over those
which were on his bed, and three earthen
bottles which held heated water were put
in his bed; and yet the old man got no
warmth.</p>

<p>"I'll manage now alone," said Lisbeth
on the Saturday morning. "You'll have
Jennie and her young gentleman home
for Sunday. Should he turn for the worse
I'll send for you."</p>

<p>Olwen left, and in the afternoon came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<i>p</i>  14]</span>
Jennie and Charlie from the drapery shop
in which they were engaged; and sighing
and sobbing she related to them her
father's will.</p>

<p>"If I was you, ma," Jennie counseled,
"I wouldn't leave him too much alone
with Aunt Liz. You never can tell.
Funny things may happen."</p>

<p>"I'd trust Aunt Liz anywhere," Olwen
declared, loath to have her sister charged
with unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Charlie?" asked
Jennie.</p>

<p>The young man stiffened his slender
body and inclined his pale face and rubbed
his nape, and he proclaimed that there
was no discourse of which the meaning
was hidden from him and no device with
which he was not familiar; and he
answered: "I would stick on the spot."</p>

<p>That night Olwen made her customary
address to God, and before she came up
from her knees or uncovered her eyes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<i>p</i>  15]</span>she extolled to God the acts of her father
Adam. But slumber kept from her because
of that which Jennie had spoken;
and diffiding the humor of her heart, she
said to herself: "Liz must have a chance
of going on with some work." At that
she slept; and early in the day she was
in Cartref.</p>

<p>"Jennie and Charlie insist you rest," she
told Lisbeth. "She can manage quite
nicely, and there's Charlie which is a help.
So should any one who is twenty-three."</p>

<p>For a week the daughters waited on
their father and contrived they never so
wittily to free him from his disorder&mdash;Did
they not strip and press against him?&mdash;they
could not deliver him from the wind
of dead men's feet. They stitched black
cloth into garments and while they stitched
they mumbled the doleful hymns of Sion.
Two yellow plates were fixed on Adam's
coffin&mdash;this was in accordance with the
man's request&mdash;and the engraving on one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<i>p</i>  16]</span>was in the Welsh tongue, and on the other
in the English tongue, and the reason was
this: that the angel who lifts the lid&mdash;be
he of the English or of the Welsh&mdash;shall
know immediately that the dead is of the
people chosen to have the first seats in
the Mansion.</p>

<p>The sisters removed from Cartref such
things as pleased them; Lisbeth chose more
than Olwen, for her house was bare; and
in the choosing each gave in to the other,
and neither harbored a mean thought.</p>

<p>With her chattels and her sewing
machine, Lisbeth entered number seven,
which is in Park Villas, and separated
from the railway by a wood paling, and
from then on the sisters lived by the rare
fruits of their joint industry; and never,
except on the Sabbath, did they shed
their thimbles or the narrow bright scissors
which hung from their waists. Some of
the poor middle-class folk near-by brought
to them their measures of materials, and
the more honorable folk who dwelt in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<i>p</i>  17]</span>avenues beyond Upper Richmond Road
crossed the steep railway bridge with
blouses and skirts to be reformed.</p>

<p>"We might be selling Cartref now," said
Olwen presently.</p>

<p>"I leave it to you," Lisbeth remarked.</p>

<p>"And I leave it to you. It's as much
yours as mine."</p>

<p>"Suppose we consult Charlie?"</p>

<p>"He's a man, and he'll do the best he
can."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's very cute is Charlie."</p>

<p>Charlie gave an ear unto Olwen, and he
replied: "You been done in. It's disgraceful
how's she's took everything that
were best."</p>

<p>"She had nothing to go on with," said
Olwen. "And it will come back. It will
be all Jennie's."</p>

<p>"What guarantee have you of that?
That's my question. What guarantee?"</p>

<p>Olwen was silent. She was not wishful
of disparaging her sister or of squabbling
with Charlie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<i>p</i>  18]</span>"Well," said Charlie, "I must have an
entirely free hand. Give it an agent if
you prefer. They're a lively lot."</p>

<p>He went about over-praising Cartref.
"With the sticks and they're not rubbish,"
he swore, "it's worth five hundred. Three-fifty
will buy the lot."</p>

<p>A certain man said to him: "I'll give
you two-twenty"; and Charlie replied:
"Nothing doing."</p>

<p>Twelve months he was in selling the
house, and for the damage which in the
meanseason had been done to it by a bomb
and by fire and water the sum of money
that he received was one hundred and fifty
pounds.</p>

<p>Lisbeth had her share, and Olwen had
her share, and each applauded Charlie,
Lisbeth assuring him: "You'll never regret
it"; and this is how Charlie applauded
himself: "No one else could have got so
much."</p>

<p>"The house and cash will be a nice egg-nest
for Jennie," Olwen announced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<i>p</i>  19]</span>"And number seven and mine will make
it more," added Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"It's a great comfort that she'll never
want a roof over her," said Olwen.</p>

<p>Mindful of their vows to their father,
the sisters lived at peace and held their
peace in the presence of their prattling
neighbors. On Sundays, togged in black
gowns on which were ornaments of jet,
they worshiped in the Congregational
Chapel; and as they stood up in their
pew, you saw that Olwen was as the tall
trunk of a tree at whose shoulders are the
stumps of chopped branches, and that Lisbeth's
body was as a billhook. Once they
journeyed to Aberporth and they laid a
wreath of wax flowers and a thick layer
of gravel on their mother's grave. They
tore a gap in the wall which divided their
little gardens, and their feet, so often did
one visit the other, trod a path from backdoor
to backdoor.</p>

<p>Nor was their love confused in the
joy that each had in Jennie, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<i>p</i>  20]</span>whom sacrifices were made and treasures
hoarded.</p>

<p>But Jennie was discontented, puling for
what she could not have, mourning her
lowly fortune, deploring her spinsterhood.</p>

<p>"Bert and me are getting married
Christmas," she said on a day.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better wait a while," said
Olwen. "You're young."</p>

<p>"We talked of that. Charlie is getting
on. He's thirty-eight, or will be in January.
We'll keep on in the shop and have
sleep-out vouchers and come here week-ends."</p>

<p>As the manner is, the mother wept.</p>

<p>"You've nothing to worry about," Lisbeth
assuaged her sister. "He's steady
and respectable. We must see that she
does it in style. You look after the other
arrangements and I'll see to her clothes."</p>

<p>She walked through wind and rain and
sewed by day and night, without heed of
the numbness which was creeping into her
limbs; and on the floor of a box she put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<i>p</i>  21]</span>six jugs which had been owned by the
Welshwoman who was Adam's grandmother,
and over the jugs she arrayed the
clothes she had made, and over all she put
a piece of paper on which she had written,
"To my darling niece from her Aunt
Lisbeth."</p>

<p>Jennie examined her aunt's handiwork
and was exceedingly wrathful.</p>

<p>"I shan't wear them," she cried. "She
might have spoken to me before she started.
After all, it's my wedding. Not hers.
Pwf! I can buy better jugs in the six-pence-apenny
bazaar."</p>

<p>"Aunt Liz will alter them," Olwen
began.</p>

<p>"I agree with her," said Charlie.
"Aunt Liz should be more considerate
seeing what I have done for her. But for
me she wouldn't have any money at all."</p>

<p>Charlie and Jennie stirred their rage and
gave utterance to the harshest sayings they
could devise about Lisbeth; "and I don't
care if she's listening outside the door,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<i>p</i>  22]</span>
said Charlie; "and you can tell her it's
me speaking," said Jennie.</p>

<p>Throughout Saturday and Sunday
Jennie pouted and dealt rudely and uncivilly
with her mother; and on Monday,
at the hour she was preparing to depart,
Olwen relented and gave her twenty
pounds, wherefore on the wedding day
Lisbeth was astonished.</p>

<p>"Why aren't you wearing my presents?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"That's it," Jennie shouted. "Don't
you forget to throw cold water, will you?
It wouldn't be you if you did. I don't
want to. See? And if you don't like
it, lump it."</p>

<p>Olwen calmed her sister, whispering:
"She's excited. Don't take notice."</p>

<p>At the quickening of the second dawn
after Christmas, Jennie and Bert arose,
and Jennie having hidden her wedding-ring,
they two went about their business;
and when at noon Olwen proceeded to
number seven, she found that Lisbeth had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<i>p</i>  23]</span>been taken sick of the palsy and was fallen
upon the floor. Lisbeth was never well
again, and what time she understood all
that Olwen had done for her, she melted
into tears.</p>

<p>"I should have gone but for you," she
averred. "The money's Jennie's, which is
the same as I had it and under the mattress,
and the house is Jennie's."</p>

<p>"She's fortunate," returned Olwen.
"She'll never want for ten shillings a
week which it will fetch. You are kind
indeed."</p>

<p>"Don't neglect them for me," Lisbeth
urged. "I'll be quite happy if you drop
in occasionally."</p>

<p>"Are you not my sister?" Olwen cried.
"I'm having a bed for you in our front
sitting-room. You won't be lonely."</p>

<p>Winter, spring, and summer passed, and
the murmurs of Jennie and Charlie against
Lisbeth were grown into a horrid clamor.</p>

<p>"Hush, she'll hear you," Olwen always
implored. "It won't be for much longer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<i>p</i>  24]</span>
The doctor says she may go any minute."</p>

<p>"Or last ages," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"Jennie will have the house and the
money," Olwen pleaded. "And the
money hasn't been touched. Same as you
gave it to her. She showed it to me under
the mattress. Not every one have two
houses."</p>

<p>"By then you will have bought it over
and over again," said Charlie. "Doesn't
give Jennie and me much chance of saving,
does it?"</p>

<p>"And she can't eat this and can't eat
that," Jennie screamed. "She won't, she
means."</p>

<p>Weekly was Olwen harassed with new
disputes, and she rued that she had said:
"I'll have a bed for you in our front sitting-room";
and as it falls out in family
quarrels, she sided with her daughter and
her daughter's husband.</p>

<p>So the love of the sisters became forced
and strained, each speaking and answering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<i>p</i>  25]</span>with an ill-favored mouth; it was no longer
entire and nothing that was professed
united it together.</p>

<p>"I must make my will now," Lisbeth
hinted darkly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Charlie will oblige you," replied
Olwen.</p>

<p>"Charlie! You make me smile. Why,
he can't keep a wife."</p>

<p>"I thought you had settled all that,"
Olwen faltered.</p>

<p>"Did you? Anyway, I'll have it in
black and white. The minister will do it."</p>

<p>After the minister was gone away, Lisbeth
said: "I couldn't very well approach
him. He's worried about money for the
new vestry. Why didn't you tell me about
the new vestry? It was in the magazine."</p>

<p>Olwen mused and from her musings
came this: "It'll be a pity to spoil it
now. For Jennie's sake."</p>

<p>She got very soft pillows and clean bed-clothes
for Lisbeth and she placed toothsome
dishes before Lisbeth; and it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<i>p</i>  26]</span>
Lisbeth's way to probe with a fork all the
dishes that Olwen had made and to say
"It's badly burnt," or "You didn't give
much for this," or "Of course you were
never taught to cook."</p>

<p>For three years Olwen endured her
sister's taunts and the storms of her daughter
and her son-in-law; and then Jennie
said: "I'm going to have a baby." If
she was glad and feared to hear this, how
much greater was her joy and how much
heavier was her anxiety as Jennie's space
grew narrower? She left over going to the
aid of Lisbeth, from whom she took away
the pillows and for whom she did not
provide any more toothsome dishes; she
did not go to her aid howsoever frantic
the beatings on the wall or fierce the outcry.
Never has a sentry kept a closer look-out
than Olwen for Jennie. Albeit Jennie
died, and as Olwen looked at the hair
which was faded from the hue of daffodils
into that of tow and at the face the
cream of the skin of which was now like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<i>p</i>  27]</span>clay, she hated Lisbeth with the excess that
she had loved her.</p>

<p>"My dear child shall go to Heaven like
a Princess," she said; and she sat at her
work table to fashion a robe of fine cambric
and lace for her dead.</p>

<p>Disturbed by the noise of the machine,
Lisbeth wailed: "You let me starve but
won't let me sleep. Why doesn't any one
help me? I'll get the fever. What have
I done?"</p>

<p>Olwen moved to the doorway of the
room, her body filling the frame thereof,
her scissors hanging at her side.</p>

<p>"You are wrong, sister, to starve me,"
Lisbeth said. "To starve me. I cannot
walk you know. You must not blame
me if I change my mind about my money.
It was wrong of you."</p>

<p>Olwen did not answer.</p>

<p>"Dear me," Lisbeth cried, "supposing
our father in Heaven knew how you treat
me. Indeed the vestry shall have my bit.
I might be a pig in a pigsty. I'll get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<i>p</i>  28]</span>the fever. Supposing our father is looking
through the window of Heaven at your
cruelty to me."</p>

<p>Olwen muttered the burden of her care:
"'The wife would pull through if she had
plenty of attention. How could she with
her about? The two of you killed her.
You did. I warned you to give up everything
and see to her. But you neglected
her.' That's what Charlie will say. Hoo-hoo.
'It's unheard of for a woman to die
before childbirth. Serves you right if I
have an inquest.'..."</p>

<p>"For shame to keep from me now," said
Lisbeth in a voice that was higher than
the continued muttering of Olwen. "Have
you no regard for the living? The dead is
dead. And you made too much of Jennie.
You spoiled her...."</p>

<p>On a sudden Olwen ceased, and she
strode up to the bed and thrust her scissors
into Lisbeth's breast.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<i>p</i>  29]</span></p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<h2>ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN</h2>


<p>On the eve of a Communion Sunday
Simon Idiot espied Dull Anna washing
her feet in the spume on the shore; he
came out of his hiding-place and spoke
jestingly to Anna and enticed her into
Blind Cave, where he had sport with her.
In the ninth year of her child, whom she
had called Abel, Anna stretched out her
tongue at the schoolmaster and took her
son to the man who farmed Deinol.</p>

<p>"Brought have I your scarecrow," she
said. "Give you to me the brown pennies
that you will pay for him."</p>

<p>From dawn to sunset Abel stood on a
hedge, waving his arms, shouting, and
mimicking the sound of gunning.
Weary of his work he vowed a vow that
he would not keep on at it. He walked
to Morfa and into his mother's cottage;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<i>p</i>  32]</span>his mother listened to him, then she took a
stick and beat him until he could not rest
nor move with ease.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dear little man. "Bach" is the Welsh masculine for "dear"; "fach" the Welsh feminine for "dear."</span></p>

<p>"Break him in like a frisky colt,
<ins title="Footnote: Dear little man. 'Bach' is the Welsh masculine for 'dear'; 'fach' the Welsh feminine for 'dear.'">little man bach,"</ins> said Anna to the farmer.
"Know you he is the son of Satan. Have
I not told how the Bad Man came to me
in my sound sleep and was naughty with
me?"</p>

<p>But the farmer had compassion on Abel
and dealt with him kindly, and when Abel
married he let him live in Tybach&mdash;the
mud-walled, straw-thatched, two-roomed
house which is midway on the hill that
goes down from Synod Inn into Morfa&mdash;and
he let him farm six acres of
land.</p>

<p>The young man and his bride so labored
that the people thereabout were confounded;
they stirred earlier and lay down
later than any honest folk; and they took
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<i>p</i>  33]</span>more eggs and tubs of butter to market
than even Deinol, and their pigs fattened
wondrously quick.</p>

<p>Twelve years did they live thus wise.
For the woman these were years of toil
and child-bearing; after she had borne
seven daughters, her sap husked and
dried up.</p>

<p>Now the spell of Abel's mourning was
one of ill-fortune for Deinol, the master
of which was grown careless: hay rotted
before it was gathered and corn before it
was reaped; potatoes were smitten by a
blight, a disease fell upon two cart-horses,
and a heifer was drowned in the sea.
Then the farmer felt embittered, and by
day and night he drank himself drunk in
the inns of Morfa.</p>

<p>Because he wanted Deinol, Abel brightened
himself up: he wore whipcord leggings
over his short legs, and a preacher's
coat over his long trunk, a white and red
patterned celluloid collar about his neck,
and a bowler hat on the back of his head;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<i>p</i>  34]</span>and his side-whiskers were trimmed in the
shape of a spade. He had joy of many
widows and spinsters, to each of whom he
said: "There's a grief-livener you are,"
and all of whom he gave over on hearing
of the widow of Drefach. Her he married,
and with the money he got with her,
and the money he borrowed, he bought
Deinol. Soon he was freed from the
hands of his lender. He had eight horses
and twelve cows, and he had oxen and
heifers, and pigs and hens, and he had
twenty-five sheep grazing on his moorland.
As his birth and poverty had caused
him to be scorned, so now his gains caused
him to be respected. The preacher of
Capel Dissenters in Morfa saluted him on
the tramping road and in shop, and
brought him down from the gallery to the
Big Seat. Even if Abel had land, money,
and honor, his vessel of contentment was
not filled until his wife went into her deathbed
and gave him a son.</p>

<p>"Indeed me," he cried, "Benshamin his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<i>p</i>  35]</span>name shall be. The Large Maker gives
and a One He is for taking away."</p>

<p>He composed a prayer of thankfulness
and of sorrow; and this prayer he recited
to the congregation which gathered at the
graveside of the woman from Drefach.</p>

<p>Benshamin grew up in the way of Capel
Dissenters. He slept with his father and
ate apart from his sisters, for his mien
was lofty. At the age of seven he knew
every question and answer in the book
"Mother's Gift," with sayings from which
he scourged sinners; and at the age of
eight he delivered from memory the Book
of Job at the Seiet; at that age also he
was put among the elders in the Sabbath
School.</p>

<p>He advanced, waxing great in religion.
On the nights of the Saying and Searching
of the Word he was with the cunningest
men, disputing with the preacher, stressing
his arguments with his fingers, and
proving his learning with phrases from
the sermons of the saintly Shones Talysarn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<i>p</i>  36]</span>If one asked him: "What are you going,
Ben Abel Deinol?" he always answered:
"The errander of the White Gospel
fach."</p>

<p>His father communed with the preacher,
who said: "Pity quite sinful if the boy
is not in the pulpit."</p>

<p>"Like that do I think as well too,"
replied Abel. "Eloquent he is. Grand
he is spouting prayers at his bed. Weep
do I."</p>

<p>Neighbors neglected their fields and
barnyards to hear the lad's shoutings to
God. Once Ben opened his eyes and rebuked
those who were outside his room.</p>

<p>"Shamed you are, not for certain," he
said to them. "Come in, boys Capel.
Right you hear the Gospel fach. Youngish
am I but old is my courtship of King
Jesus who died on the tree for scamps of
parsons."</p>

<p>He shut his eyes and sang of blood,
wood, white shirts, and thorns; of the
throng that would arise from the burial-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<i>p</i>  37]</span>ground,
in which there were more graves
than molehills in the shire. He cried
against the heathenism of the Church,
the wickedness of Church tithes, and
against ungodly book-prayers and short
sermons.</p>

<p>Early Ben entered College Carmarthen,
where his piety&mdash;which was an adage&mdash;was
above that of any student. Of him
this was said: "'White Jesus bach is as
plain on his lips as the purse of a big
bull.'"</p>

<p>Brightness fell upon him. He had a
name for the tearfulness and splendor
of his eloquence. He could conduct himself
fancifully: now he was Pharaoh wincing
under the plagues, now he was the
Prodigal Son longing to eat at the pigs'
trough, now he was the Widow of Nain
rejoicing at the recovery of her son, now
he was a parson in Nineveh squirming
under the prophecy of Jonah; and his
hearers winced or longed, rejoiced or
squirmed. Congregations sought him to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<i>p</i>  38]</span>preach in their pulpits, and he chose such
as offered the highest reward, pledging
the richest men for his wage and the cost
of his entertainment and journey. But
Ben would rule over no chapel. "I wait
for the call from above," he said.</p>

<p>His term at Carmarthen at an end, he
came to Deinol. His father met him in
a doleful manner.</p>

<p>"An old boy very cruel is the Parson,"
Abel whined. "Has he not strained Gwen
for his tithes? Auction her he did and
bought her himself for three pounds and
half a pound."</p>

<p>Ben answered: "Go now and say the
next Saturday Benshamin Lloyd will give
mouthings on tithes in Capel Dissenters."</p>

<p>Ben stood in the pulpit, and spoke to
the people of Capel Dissenters.</p>

<p>"How many of you have been to his
church?" he cried. "Not one male bach
or one female fach. Go there the next
Sabbath, and the black muless will not
say to you: 'Welcome you are, persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<i>p</i>  39]</span>
Capel. But there's glad am I to see you.'
A comic sermon you will hear. A sermon
got with half-a-crown postal order.
Ask Postman. Laugh highly you will
and stamp on the floor. Funny is the
Parson in the white frock. Ach y fy,
why for he doesn't have a coat preacher
like Respecteds? Ask me that. From
where does his Church come from? She
is the inheritance of Satan. The only
thing he had to leave, and he left her to
his friends the parsons. Iss-iss, earnest
affair is this. Who gives him his food?
We. Who pays for Vicarage? We.
Who feeds his pony? We. His cows?
We. Who built his church? We. With
stones carted from our quarries and mortar
messed about with the tears of our
mothers and the blood of our fathers."</p>

<p>At the gate of the chapel men discussed
Ben's words; and two or three of them
stole away and herded Gwen into the
corner of the field; and they caught her
and cut off her tail, and drove a staple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<i>p</i>  40]</span>into her udder. Sunday morning eleven
men from Capel Dissenters, with iron
bands to their clogs on their feet, and white
aprons before their bellies, shouted without
the church: "We are come to pray
from the book." The Parson was affrighted,
and left over tolling his bell, and
he bolted and locked the door, against
which he set his body as one would set
the stub of a tree.</p>

<p>Running at the top of their speed the
railers came to Ben, telling how the Parson
had put them to shame.</p>

<p>"Iobs you are," Ben answered. "The
boy bach who loses the key of his house
breaks into his house. Does an old wench
bar the dairy to her mishtress?"</p>

<p>The men returned each to his abode, and
an hour after midday they gathered in
the church burial-ground, and they drew
up a tombstone, and with it rammed the
door; and they hurled stones at the
windows; and in the darkness they built
a wall of dung in the room of the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<i>p</i>  41]</span>Repentance sank into the Parson as he
saw and remembered that which had been
done to him. He called to him his servant
Lissi Workhouse, and her he told to
take Gwen to Deinol. The cow lowed
woefully as she was driven; she was heard
even in Morfa, and many hurried to the
road to witness her.</p>

<p>Abel was at the going in of the close.</p>

<p>"Well-well, Lissi Workhouse," he said,
"what's doing then?"</p>

<p>"'Go give the male his beast,' mishtir
talked."</p>

<p>"Right for you are," said Abel.</p>

<p>"Right for enough is the rascal. But a
creature without blemish he pilfered. Hit
her and hie her off."</p>

<p>As Lissi was about to go, Ben cried
from within the house: "The cow the
fulbert had was worth two of his cows."</p>

<p>"Sure, iss-iss," said Abel. "Go will I
to Vicarage with boys capel. Bring the
baston, Ben bach."</p>

<p>Ben came out, and his ardor warmed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<i>p</i>  42]</span>up on beholding Lissi's broad hips, scarlet
cheeks, white teeth, and full bosoms.</p>

<p>"Not blaming you, girl fach, am I," he
said. "My father, journey with Gwen.
Walk will I with Lissi Workhouse."</p>

<p>That afternoon Abel brought a cow in
calf into his close; and that night Ben
crossed the mown hayfields to the Vicarage,
and he threw a little gravel at Lissi's
window.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The hay was gathered and stacked and
thatched, and the corn was cut down, and
to the women who were gleaning his
father's oats, Ben said how that Lissi was
in the family way.</p>

<p>"Silence your tone, indeed," cried one,
laughing. "No sign have I seen."</p>

<p>"If I died," observed a large woman,
"boy bach pretty innocent you are, Benshamin.
Four months have I yet. And
not showing much do I."</p>

<p>"No," said another, "the bulk might
be only the coil of your apron, ho-ho."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<i>p</i>  43]</span>"Whisper to us," asked the large
woman, "who the foxer is. Keep the
news will we."</p>

<p>"Who but the scamp of the Parson?"
replied Ben. "What a sow of a
hen."</p>

<p>By such means Ben shifted his offense.
On being charged by the Parson he rushed
through the roads crying that the enemy
of the Big Man had put unbecoming
words on a harlot's tongue. Capel Dissenters
believed him. "He could not act
wrongly with a sheep," some said.</p>

<p>So Ben tasted the sapidness and relish
of power, and his desires increased.</p>

<p>"Mortgage Deinol, my father bach," he
said to Abel. "Going am I to London.
Heavy shall I be there. None of the
dirty English are like me."</p>

<p>"Already have I borrowed for your
college. No more do I want to have.
How if I sell a horse?"</p>

<p>"Sell you the horse too, my father
bach."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<i>p</i>  44]</span>"Done much have I for you," Abel
said. "Fairish I must be with your
sisters."</p>

<p>"Why for you cavil like that, father?
The money of mam came to Deinol. Am
I not her son?"</p>

<p>Though his daughters, murmured&mdash;"We
wake at the caw of the crows," they
said, "and weary in the young of the
day"&mdash;Abel obeyed his son, who thereupon
departed and came to Thornton
East to the house of Catherine Jenkins,
a widow woman, with whom he took the
appearance of a burning lover.</p>

<p>Though he preached with a view at
many English chapels in London, none
called him. He caused Abel to sell cattle
and mortgage Deinol for what it was
worth and to give him all the money he
received therefrom; he swore such hot
love for Catherine that the woman pawned
her furniture for his sake.</p>

<p>Intrigued that such scant fruit had come
up from his sowings, Ben thought of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<i>p</i>  45]</span>further ways of stablishing himself. He
inquired into the welfare of shop-assistants
from women and girls who worshiped in
Welsh chapels, and though he spoiled
several in his quest, the abominations
which oppressed these workers were made
known to him. Shop-assistants carried
abroad his fame and called him "Fiery
Taffy." Ben showed them how to rid
themselves of their burden; "a burden,"
he said, "packed full and overflowing by
men of my race&mdash;the London Welsh
drapers."</p>

<p>The Welsh drapers were alarmed, and
in a rage with Ben. They took the opinion
of their big men and performed slyly.
Enos-Harries&mdash;this is the Enos-Harries
who has a drapery shop in Kingsend&mdash;sent
to Ben this letter: "Take Dinner with Slf
and Wife same, is Late Dinner I am

Establishment only as per printed Note
Heading. And Oblige."</p>

<p>Enos-Harries showed Ben his house, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<i>p</i>  46]</span>told him the cost of the treasures that
were therein.</p>

<p>Also Harries said: "I have learned of
you as a promising Welshman, and I want
to do a good turn for you with a speech
by you on St. David's Day at Queen's
Hall. Now, then."</p>

<p>"I am not important enough for
that."</p>

<p>"She'll be a first-class miting in tip-top
speeches. All the drapers and dairies
shall be there in crowds. Three sirs shall
come."</p>

<p>"I am choked with engagements," said
Ben. "I am preaching very busy now
just."</p>

<p>"Well-well. Asked I did for you are
a clean Cymro bach. As I repeat, only
leading lines in speakers shall be there.
Come now into the drawing-room and
I'll give you an intro to the Missus Enos-Harries.
In evening dress she is&mdash;chik
Paris Model. The invoice price was ten-ten."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<i>p</i>  47]</span>"Wait a bit," Ben remarked. "I would
be glad if I could speak."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the next time we give you
the invite. The Cymrodorion shall be in
the miting."</p>

<p>"As you plead, try I will."</p>

<p>"Stretching a point am I," Harries
said. "This is a favor for you to address
this glorious miting where the Welsh
drapers will attend and the Missus Enos-Harries
will sing 'Land of my Fathers.'"</p>

<p>Ben withdrew from his fellows for three
days, and on the third day&mdash;which was
that of the Saint&mdash;he put on him a frock
coat, and combed down his mustache over
the blood-red swelling on his lip; and he
cleaned his teeth. Here are some of the
sayings that he spoke that night:</p>

<p>"Half an hour ago we were privileged
to listen to the voice of a lovely lady&mdash;a
voice as clear as a diamond ring. It inspired
us one and all with a hireath for
the dear old homeland&mdash;for dear Wales,
for the land of our fathers and mothers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<i>p</i>  48]</span>too, for the land that is our heritage not
by Act of Parliament but by the Act of
God....</p>

<p>"Who ownss this land to-day? The
squaire and the parshon. By what right?
By the same right as the thief who steals
your silk and your laces, and your milk
and butter, and your reddy-made blousis.
I know a farm of one hundred acres, each
rod having been tamed from heatherland
into a manna of abundance. Tamed by
human bones and muscles&mdash;God's invested
capital in His chosen children. Six
months ago this land&mdash;this fertile and
rich land&mdash;was wrestled away from the
owners. The bones of the living and the
dead were wrestled away. I saw it three
months ago&mdash;a wylderness. The clod had
been squeesed of its zweat. The land
belonged to my father, and his father,
and his father, back to countless generations....</p>

<p>"I am proud to be among my people
to-night. How sorry I am for any one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<i>p</i>  49]</span>who are not Welsh. We have a language
as ancient as the hills that shelter us, and
the rivers that never weery of refreshing
us....</p>

<p>"Only recently a few shop-assistants&mdash;a
handful of counter-jumpers&mdash;tried to
shake the integrity of our commerse. But
their white cuffs held back their aarms,
and the white collars choked their aambitions.
When I was a small boy my mam
used to tell me how the chief Satan was
caught trying to put his hand over the sun
so as to give other satans a chance of doing
wrong on earth in the dark. That was
the object of these misguided fools. They
had no grievances. I have since investigated
the questions of living-in and fines.
Both are fair and necessary. The man who
tries to destroy them is like the swimmer
who plunges among the water lilies to be
dragged into destruction....</p>

<p>"Welsh was talked in the Garden of
Aden. That is where commerse began.
Didn't Eve buy the apple?...</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<i>p</i>  50]</span>"Ladies and gentlemen, Cymrodorion,
listen. There is a going in these classical
old rafterss. It is the coming of God.
And the message He gives you this night
is this: 'Men of Gwalia, march on and
keep you tails up.'"</p>

<p>From that hour Ben flourished. He
broke his league with the shop-assistants.
Those whom he had troubled lost courage
and humbled themselves before their employers;
but their employers would have
none of them, man or woman, boy or girl.</p>

<p>Vexation followed his prosperity. His
father reproached him, writing: "Sad I
drop into the Pool as old Abel Tybach, and
not as Lloyd Deinol." Catherine harassed
him to recover her house and chattels. To
these complainings he was deaf. He married
the daughter of a wealthy Englishman,
who set him up in a large house in
the midst of a pleasure garden; and of
the fatness and redness of his wife he was
sickened before he was wedded to her.</p>

<p>By studying diligently, the English lan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<i>p</i>  51]</span>guage
became as familiar to him as the
Welsh language. He bound himself to
Welsh politicians and engaged himself in
public affairs, and soon he was as an idol
to a multitude of people, who were sensible
only to his well-sung words, and who
did not know that his utterances veiled
his own avarice and that of his masters.
All that he did was for profit, and yet
he could not win enough.</p>

<p>Men and women, soothed into false ease
and quickened into counterfeit wrath, commended
him, crying: "Thank God for Ben
Lloyd." Such praise puffed him up, and
howsoever mighty he was in the view of
fools, he was mightier in his own view.</p>

<p>"At the next election I'll be in Parliament,"
he boasted in his vanity. "The
basis of my solidity&mdash;strength&mdash;is as immovable&mdash;is
as impregnable as Birds' Rock
in Morfa."</p>

<p>Though the grandson of Simon Idiot
and Dull Anna prophesied great things
for himself, it was evil that came to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<i>p</i>  52]</span>He trembled from head to foot to ravish
every comely woman on whom his ogling
eyes dwelt. His greed made him faithless
to those whom he professed to serve: in
his eagerness to lift himself he planned,
plotted, and trafficked with the foes of his
officers. Hearing that an account of his
misdeeds was spoken abroad, he called the
high London Welshmen into a room, and
he said to them:</p>

<p>"These cruel slanderers have all but
broken my spirit. They are the wicked
inventions of fiends incarnate. It is not
my fall that is required&mdash;if that were so
I would gladly make the sacrifise&mdash;the
zupreme sacrifise, if wanted&mdash;but it is the
fall of the Party that these men are after.
He who repeats one foul thing is doing
his level best to destroy the fabric of this
magnificent organisation that has been
reared by your brains. It has no walls
of stone and mortar, yet it is a sity builded
by men. We must have no more bickerings.
We have work to do. The seeds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<i>p</i>  53]</span>are springing forth, and a goodly harvest
is promised: let us sharpen our blades
and clear our barn floors. Cymru fydd&mdash;Wales
for the Welsh&mdash;is here. At home
and at Westminster our kith and kin
are occupying prominent positions. Disestablishment
is at hand. We have closed
public-houses and erected chapels, each
chapel being a factor in the education of
the masses in ideas of righteous government.
You, my friends, have secured
much of the land, around which you have
made walls, and in which you have set
water fountains, and have planted rare
plants and flowers. And you have put up
your warning signs on it&mdash;'Trespassers
will be prosecuted.'</p>

<p>"There is coming the Registration of
Workers Act, by which every worker will
be held to his locality, to his own enormous
advantage. And it will end strikes, and
trades unionism will deservedly crumble.
In future these men will be able to settle
down, and with God's blessing bring chil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<i>p</i>  54]</span>dren
into the world, and their condition
will be a delight unto themselves and a
profit to the community.</p>

<p>"But we must do more. I must do
more. And you must help me. We
must stand together. Slander never
creates; it shackles and kills. We must
be solid. Midway off the Cardigan coast&mdash;in
beautiful Morfa&mdash;there is a rock&mdash;Birds'
Rock. As a boy I used to climb to
the top of it, and watch the waters swirling
and tumbling about it, and around it
and against it. But I was unafraid. For
I knew that the rock was old when man
was young, and that it had braved all
the washings of the sea."</p>

<p>The men congratulated Ben; and Ben
came home and he stood at a mirror,
and shaping his body put out his arms.</p>

<p>"How's this for my maiden speech in
the house?" he asked his wife. Presently
he paused. "You're a fine one to
be an M.P.'s lady," he said. "You stout,
underworked fool."</p>

<p>Ben urged on his imaginings: he ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<i>p</i>  55]</span>vised
his monarch, and to him for favors
merchants brought their gold, and mothers
their daughters. Winter and spring
moved, and then his mind brought his
enemies to his door.</p>

<p>"As the root of a tree spreads in the
bosom of the earth," he said, "so my fame
shall spread over the world"; and he built
a fence about his house.</p>

<p>But his mind would not be stilled.
Every midnight his enemies were at the
fence, and he could not sleep for the
dreadful outcry; every midnight he arose
from his bed and walked aside the fence,
testing the strength of it with a hand and
a shoulder and shooing away his enemies
as one does a brood of chickens from a
cornfield.</p>

<p>His fortieth summer ran out&mdash;a season
of short days and nights speeding on the
heels of night. Then peace fell upon him;
and at dusk of a day he came into his
room, and he saw one sitting in a chair.
He went up to the chair and knelt on a
knee, and said: "Your Majesty...."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<i>p</i>  56]</span></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<i>p</i>  57]</span></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h2>THE TWO APOSTLES</h2>


<p>God covered sun, moon, and stars, stilled
the growing things of the earth and dried
up the waters on the face of the earth,
and stopped the roll of the world; and
He fixed upon a measure of time in which
to judge the peoples, this being the
measure which was spoken of as the Day
of Judgment.</p>

<p>In the meanseason He summoned Satan
to the Judgment Hall, which is at the
side of the river that breaks into four heads,
and above which, its pulpits stretching beyond
the sky, is the Palace of White
Shirts, and below which, in deep darknesses,
are the frightful regions of the
Fiery Oven. "Give an account of your
rule in the face of those whom you provoked
to mischief," He said to Satan.
"My balance hitched to a beam will weigh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<i>p</i>  60]</span>the good and evil of my children, and if
good is heavier than evil, I shall lighten
your countenance and clothe you with the
robes of angels."</p>

<p>"Awake the dead" He bade the
Trumpeter, and "Lift the lids off the
burying-places" He bade the laborers. In
their generations were they called; "for,"
said the Lord, "good and evil are customs
of a period and when the period is passed
and the next is come, good may be evil and
evil may be good."</p>

<p>Now God did not put His entire trust
in Satan, and in the evening of the day
He set to prove him: "It is over."</p>

<p>"My Lord, so be it," answered Satan.</p>

<p>"How now?" asked God.</p>

<p>"The scale of wickedness sways like a
kite in the wind," cried Satan. "Give me
my robes and I will transgress against you
no more."</p>

<p>"In the Book of Heaven and Hell,"
said God, "there is no writing of the last
of the Welsh."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<i>p</i>  61]</span>Satan spoke up: "My Lord, your
pledge concerned those judged on the Day
of Judgment. Day is outing. The windows
of the Mansion are lit; hark the
angels tuning their golden strings for the
cheer of the Resurrection Supper. Give
me my robes that I may sing your
praises."</p>

<p>"Can I not lengthen the day with a
wink of my eye?"</p>

<p>"All things you can do, my Lord, but
observe your pledge to me. Allow these
people to rest a while longer. Their number
together with the number of their sins
is fewer than the hairs on Elisha's head."</p>

<p>God laughed in His heart as He replied
to Satan: "Tell the Trumpeter to take
his horn and the laborers their spades and
bring to me the Welsh."</p>

<p>The laborers digged, and at the sound
of the horn the dead breathed and heaved.
Those whose wit was sharp hurried into
neighboring chapels and stole Bibles and
hymn-books, with which in their pockets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<i>p</i>  62]</span>and under their arms they joined the host
in Heaven's Courtyard, whence they went
into the Waiting Chamber that is without
the Judgment Hall.</p>

<p>"Boy bach, a lot of Books of the Word
he has," a woman remarked to the Respected
Towy-Watkins. "Say him I have
one."</p>

<p>"Happy would I be to do like that,"
was the reply. "But, female, much does
the Large One regard His speeches. What
is the text on the wall? 'Prepare your
deeds for the Lord.' The Beybile is the
most religious deed. Farewell for now,"
and he pretended to go away.</p>

<p>Holding the sleeve of his White Shirt,
the woman separated her toothless gums
and fashioned her wrinkled face in grief.
"Two tens he has," she croaked. "And
his shirt is clean. Dirty am I; buried I
was as I was found, and the shovelers
beat the soil through the top of the coffin.
Do much will I for one Beybile."</p>

<p>"A poor dab you are," said Towy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<i>p</i>  63]</span>"Many deeds you have? But no odds
to me."</p>

<p>"Four I have."</p>

<p>"Woe for you, unfortunate."</p>

<p>"Iss-iss, horrid is my plight," the woman
whined. "Little I did for Him."</p>

<p>"Don't draw tears. For eternity you'll
weep. Here is a massive Beybile for your
four deeds."</p>

<p>"Take him one. Handy will three be
in the minute of the questioning."</p>

<p>"Refusing the Beybile bach you are.
Also the hymn-book&mdash;old and new notations&mdash;I
present for four. Stupid am I
as the pigger's prentice who bought the
litter in the belly."</p>

<p>"Be him soft and sell for one."</p>

<p>"I cannot say less. No relation you are
to me. Hope I do that right enough are
your four. Recite them to me, old
woman."</p>

<p>"I ate rats to provide a Beybile to
the Respected," the woman trembled.
"I&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<i>p</i>  64]</span>"You are pathetic," Towy said. "Hie
and get your tokens and have that poor
one will I because of my pity for you."</p>

<p>The woman told her deeds in Heaven's
Record Office, and she was given four
white tablets on which her deeds were inscribed;
and the rat tablet Towy took from
her. "Faith and hope are tidy heifers,"
he said, "but a stallion is charity. Priceless
Beybile I give you, sinner."</p>

<p>As he moved away Towy cried in the
manner of one selling by auction: "This
is the beloved Beybile of Jesus. This is
the book of hymns&mdash;old and new notations.
Hymns harvest, communion, funerals,
Sunday schools, and hymns for
children bach are here. Treasures bulky
for certain."</p>

<p>For some he received three tablets each,
for some five tablets each, and for some
ten tablets each. But the gaudy Bible
which was decorated with pictures and
ornamented with brass clasps and a leather
covering he did not sell; nor did he sell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<i>p</i>  65]</span>the gilt-edged hymn-book. Between the
leaves of his Bible he put his tablets&mdash;as
a preacher his markers&mdash;the writing
on each tablet confirming a verse in the
place it was set. His labor over, he
chanted: "Pen Calvaria! Pen Calvaria!
Very soon will come to view." Men and
women gazed upon him, envying him;
and those who had Bibles and hymn-books
hastened to do as he had done.</p>

<p>Among the many that came to him was
one whose name was Ben Lloyd.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Towy.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Fat is my religion after the springing,"
cried Towy. "Perished was I and
up again. Amen, Big Man. Amen and
amen. And amen.</p>

<p>"I opened my eyes and I saw a hand
thrusting aside the firmament and I heard
One calling me from the beyond, and the
One was God."</p>

<p>"Like the roar of heated bulls was the
noise, Ben bach."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<i>p</i>  66]</span>"Praise Him I did that I was laid to
rest at home. Away from the stir of Parliament.
Tell Him I will how my spirit,
though the flesh was dead, bathed in the
living rivers and walked in the peaceful
valleys of the glorious land of my fathers&mdash;thinking,
thinking of Jesus."</p>

<p>"Hold on. Not so fast. From Capel
Bryn Salem I journeyed to mouth with
my heart to the Lord, and your slut of
widow paid me only four soferens. Eloquent
sermon I spouted and four soferens
is the price of a supply."</p>

<p>"In your charity forgive her; her sorrow
was o'erpowering."</p>

<p>"Sorrow! The mule of an English!
She wasn't there."</p>

<p>"You don't say," cried Ben. "If
above she is I will have her dragged
down."</p>

<p>"Not a stone did she put over your
head, and the strumpets of your sisters
did not tend your grave. Why you were
not eaten by worms I can't know."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<i>p</i>  67]</span>On a sudden Towy shouted: "See an
old parson do I. Is not this the day of
rising up? Awful if the Big Man mistakes
us for the Church. Not been inside
a church have I, drop dead and blind,
since I was born."</p>

<p>None gave heed to his cry, for the sound
of the bargaining was most high. "Dissenters,"
he bellowed, "what right have
Church heathens to mix with us? The
Fiery Oven is their home."</p>

<p>The people were dismayed. Their number
being small, the Church folk were
pressed one upon the other; and after
they were thrown in a mass against the
gate of the Chariot House the Dissenters
spread themselves easily as far as the door
of the Crooked Stairway.</p>

<p>"Now, boys capel," Towy-Watkins
said, "we will have a sermon. Fine will
Welsh be in the nostrils of the Big
Preacher. Pray will I at once."</p>

<p>The prayer ended, and one struck his
tuning-fork; and while the congregation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<i>p</i>  68]</span>moaned and lamented, a tall man, who
wore the habit of a preacher and whose
yellow beard&mdash;the fringe of which was
singed&mdash;hung over his breast like a sheaf
of wheat, passed through the way of the
door of the Stairway, and as he walked
towards the Judgment Hall, some said:
"Fair day, Respected," and some said:
"Similar he is to Towy-Watkins."</p>

<p>"Shut your throats, colts," Towy rebuked
the people. "Say after me: 'Go
round my backhead, Satan.'"</p>

<p>"Go round my backhead, Satan," the
people obeyed.</p>

<p>"Catch him and skin him," Towy
screamed. "Teach him we will to snook
about here."</p>

<p>Fear arming his courage, Satan shouted:
"He who hurts me him shall I pitch head-long
to the flames." The people's hands
went to their sides, and Satan departed
in peace.</p>

<p>"In my heart is my head," Towy said.
"Near the Oven we are. Blow your noses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<i>p</i>  69]</span>of the stench. Young youths, herd blockheads
Church over here."</p>

<p>Before the stalwarts started on their
errand, the Overseer of the Waiting
Chamber came to the door of the lane
that takes you into the Judgment Hall,
wherefore the Dissenters wept, howled,
and whooped.</p>

<p>"Ready am I, God bach," Towy exclaimed,
stretching his hairy arms. "Take
me."</p>

<p>"Patiently I waited for the last Trump
and humbly do I now wait for the Crown
from your fingers," said Ben Lloyd. "My
deeds are recorded in the archives of the
House of Commons and the Cymrodorion
Society."</p>

<p>"Clap up," Towy admonished Ben.
"My religious actions can't be counted."</p>

<p>Lowering his eyes the Overseer murmured:
"I am not the Lord."</p>

<p>"For why did you not say that?" cried
Towy. He stepped to the Overseer.
"Hap you are Apostle Shames. A splen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<i>p</i>  70]</span>did
photo of Shames is in the Beybile with
pictures. Fond am I of preaching from
him. Lovely pieces there are. 'Abram
believed God.' Who was Abram? Father
of Isaac bach. Who made Abram? The
Big Man. And the Big Man made the
capel and the respected that is the jewel
of the capel. Is not the pulpit the throne?
Glad am I to see you, indeed, Shames."</p>

<p>The Overseer opened his lips.</p>

<p>"Enter with you will I," said Towy.
"Look through my glassy soul you can."</p>

<p>"Silence&mdash;" the Overseer began.</p>

<p>"Iss, silence for ever and ever, amen,"
said Towy. "No trial I need. How can
the Judge judge if there's no judging to
be? Go up will I then. Hope to see you
again, Shames."</p>

<p>The Overseer tightened his girdle.
"Thus saith the Lord," he proclaimed:
"'I will consider each by his deeds or all
by the deeds of their two apostles.'"</p>

<p>"Ho-ho," said Towy. "Half one moment.
Think will we. Dissenters, crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<i>p</i>  71]</span>here. Ben Lloyd, make arguments.
Tricky is old Shames."</p>

<p>The Dissenters assembled close to Ben
and Towy, and the Church people crept
near them in order to share their counsel;
but the Dissenters turned upon their
enemies and bruised them with fists and
Bibles and hymn-books, and called them
frogs, turks, thieves, atheists, blacks; and
there never has been heard such a tumult
in any house. Alarmed that he could not
part one side from the other, the Overseer
sought Satan, who had a name for crafty
dealings with disputants.</p>

<p>Satan was distressed. "If it was not
for personal reasons," he said, "I would
let them go to Hell." He sent into the
Chamber a carpenter who put a barrier
from wall to wall, and he appointed Jude
in charge of the barrier to guard that no
one went under it or over it.</p>

<p>Then the wise men of the Dissenters
continued to examine the Lord's offer;
and a thousand men declared they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<i>p</i>  72]</span>holy enough to go before God, and from
the thousand five hundred were cast out,
and from the five hundred three hundred,
and from the two hundred one hundred
were cast away. Now this hundred were
Baptists, Methodists, and Congregationalists,
and they quarreled so harshly and
decried one another so spitefully that Ben
and Towy made with them a compact to
speak specially for each of them in the
private ear of God. The strife quelled and
Towy having cried loudly: "Dissenters
and Churchers, glad you are that me and
Ben Lloyd, Hem Pee, are your apostles,"
he and Ben followed the Overseer.</p>

<p>In the Judgment Hall the two apostles
crouched to pray, and they were stirred
by Satan laying his hands on their
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Prayers are useless here, my friends,"
said the Devil. "We must proceed with
the business. I am just as anxious as
you are that everything reaches a satisfactory
conclusion."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<i>p</i>  73]</span>"I object," said Ben. "Solemnly object.
I don't know this infidel. I don't
want to know him."</p>

<p>"Go from here," Towy gruntled. "A
sweat is in my whiskers. Inhabitants, why
isn't his tongue a red-hot poker?... Well,
boys Palace, grand this is. Say
who you are?" he asked one whose face
shone like a mirror. "Respected Towy-Watkins
am I."</p>

<p>He whose face shone like a polished
mirror answered that he was Moses the
Keeper of the Balance. "The Lord is in
the Cloud," he said.</p>

<p>Towy addressed the Cloud, which was
the breadth of a man's hand, and which
was brighter than the golden halo of the
throne: "Big Man, peep at your helper.
Was not I a ruler over the capel? Religious
were my prayers."</p>

<p>"I did not hear any," said God.</p>

<p>"Mistake. Mistake. Towy bach eloquent
was I called. Here am I with the
Speech, and the Speech is God and God
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<i>p</i>  74]</span>is the Speech. Take you as a great gift
this nice hymn-book."</p>

<p>"What are hymns?" asked God.</p>

<p>"Moses, Moses," cried Towy, "explain
affairs to Him."</p>

<p>God spoke: "Satan, render your account
of the mischief you made these
men do."</p>

<p>"This is a travesty of the traditions
of the House," said Ben. "Traditions
that are dear to me, being taught them
at my mother's knees. I refuse to be
drenched in Satan's froth. Against one
who was a member of the Government
you are taking the evidence of the most
discredited man in the universe&mdash;the
world's worst sinner."</p>

<p>He ceased, because Satan had begun to
read; and Satan read rapidly, with shame,
and without pantomime, not pausing at
what times he was abused and charged
with lying; and he read correctly, for the
Records Clerk followed him word by word
in the Book of the Watchers; and for every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<i>p</i>  75]</span>sin to which he confessed Moses placed a
scarlet tablet in the scale of wickedness.</p>

<p>"I will attend to what I have heard,"
said the Lord when Satan had finished.
"Put your tablets in the scale and go
into the Chamber."</p>

<p>Ben and Towy withdrew, and as they
passed out they beheld that the scale of
scarlet tablets touched the ground.</p>

<p>Then the Cloud vanished and God came
out of the Cloud.</p>

<p>"My wrath is fierce," He said. "Bind
these Welsh and torment them with vipers
and with fire in the uttermost parts of
Hell. They shall have no more remembrance
before me."</p>

<p>"Will you destroy the just?" asked
Moses.</p>

<p>"They have chosen."</p>

<p>"Shall the godly perish because of the
godless?"</p>

<p>"I flooded the world," said God.</p>

<p>"The righteous Noah and his house and
his animals you did not destroy. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<i>p</i>  76]</span>you repented that you smote every living
thing. May not my Lord repent again?"</p>

<p>"I am not destroying every living
thing," God replied. "I am destroying
the vile."</p>

<p>"Remember Sodom and Gomorrah,
Lot's wife and his daughters. They all
sinned after their deliverance. The doings
of Sodom stayed."</p>

<p>Moses also said: "You gave your ear
to Jonah from the well of the sea."</p>

<p>"I sacrificed my Son for man."</p>

<p>"And loosed Satan upon him."</p>

<p>"Is scarlet white?" asked God.</p>

<p>"Is justice the fruit of injustice? The
two men were not of the Church, and the
Church may be holy in your sight."</p>

<p>"I have judged."</p>

<p>"And your judgment is past understanding,"
said Moses, and he sat at the
Balance.</p>

<p>The servants of the Lord spoke one
with another: "I cannot eat of the supper,"
said one; "The songs will be as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<i>p</i>  77]</span>wolf's howlings in the wilderness," said
another; "The honey will be as bittersweet
as Adam's apple," said a third.
But Satan exclaimed: "Come, let us seek
in the Book of the Watchers for an act
that will turn Him from His purpose."</p>

<p>In seeking, some put their fingers on
the leaves and advised Moses to cry unto
the Lord in such and such a manner.</p>

<p>"My voice is dumb," replied Moses.</p>

<p>Satan presently astonished the servants;
he took the book to the Lord. "My
Lord," he said, "which is the more precious&mdash;good
or evil?"</p>

<p>"Good," said the Lord.</p>

<p>"More precious than the riches of Solomon
is a deed done in your name?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Though the sins were as numerous as
the teeth of a shoal of fish?"</p>

<p>"So. Unravel your riddle."</p>

<p>"An old woman of the Dissenters," said
Satan, "claimed four tablets, whereas her
deeds were nine."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<i>p</i>  78]</span>God looked at the Balance and lo, the
scale of white tablets was heavier than the
scale of scarlet tablets.</p>

<p>"Bid hither the apostles," He commanded
the Overseer, "for they shall see
me, and this day they and their flocks shall
be in Paradise."</p>

<p>Satan stood before the face of Moses,
glowing as the angels; and he brought out
scissors to clip off the fringe of his beard.
When he had cut only a little, the Overseer
entered the Judgment Hall, saying: "The
two apostles tricked Jude and crawled
under the barrier, and they shot back the
bolts of the gate of the Chariot House and
called a charioteer to take them to Heaven.
'This is God's will,' they said to him."</p>

<p>Satan's scissors fell on the floor.</p>

<h2>EARTHBRED</h2>


<p>Because he was diseased with a consumption,
Evan Roberts in his thirtieth year
left over being a drapery assistant and
had himself hired as a milk roundsman.</p>

<p>A few weeks thereafter he said to Mary,
the woman whom he had promised to
wed: "How now if I had a milk-shop?"</p>

<p>Mary encouraged him, and searched for
that which he desired; and it came to be
that on a Thursday afternoon they two met
at the mouth of Worship Street&mdash;the narrow
lane that is at the going into Richmond.</p>

<p>"Stand here, Marri," Evan ordered.
"Go in will I and have words with the
owner. Hap I shall uncover his tricks."</p>

<p>"Very well you are," said Mary.
"Don't over-waggle your tongue. Address
him in hidden phrases."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<i>p</i>  82]</span>Evan entered the shop, and as there was
no one therein he made an account of the
tea packets and flour bags which were
on the shelves. Presently a small, fat
woman stood beyond the counter. Evan
addressed her in English: "Are you
Welsh?"</p>

<p>"That's what people say," the woman
answered.</p>

<p>"Glad am I to hear you," Evan returned
in Welsh. "Tell me how you was."</p>

<p>"A Cymro bach I see," the woman cried.
"How was you?"</p>

<p>"Peeped did I on your name on the sign.
Shall I say you are Mistress Jinkins?"</p>

<p>"Iss, indeed, man."</p>

<p>"What about affairs these close days?"</p>

<p>"Busy we are. Why for you ask?
Trade you do in milk?"</p>

<p>"Blurt did I for nothing," Evan replied.</p>

<p>"No odds, little man. Ach y fy, jealous
other milkmen are of us. There's nasty
some people are."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<i>p</i>  83]</span>"Natty shop you have. Little shop and
big traffic, Mistress Jinkins?"</p>

<p>"Quick you are."</p>

<p>"Know you Tom Mathias Tabernacle
Street?" Evan inquired.</p>

<p>"Seen him have I in the big meetings
at Capel King's Cross."</p>

<p>"Getting on he is, for certain sure.
Hundreds of pints he sells. And
groceries."</p>

<p>"Pwf," Mrs. Jenkins sneered. "Fulbert
you are to believe him. A liar without
shame is Twm. And a cheat. Bad
sampler he is of the Welsh."</p>

<p>"Speak I do as I hear. More thriving
is your concern."</p>

<p>"No boast is in me. But don't we do
thirty gallons?"</p>

<p>Evan summoned up surprise into his
face, and joy. "Dear me to goodness,"
he exclaimed. "Take something must I
now. Sell you me an egg."</p>

<p>Evan shook the egg at his ear. "She
is good," he remarked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<i>p</i>  84]</span>"Weakish is the male," observed Mrs.
Jenkins. "Much trouble he has in his
inside."</p>

<p>"Poor bach," replied Evan. "Well-well.
Fair night for to-day."</p>

<p>"Why for you are in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Woman fach, for what you do not
know that I abide in Wandsworth and the
clock is late?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins laughed. "Boy pretty sly
you are. Come you to Richmond to buy
one egg."</p>

<p>Evan coughed and spat upon the
ground, and while he cleaned away his
spittle with a foot he said: "Courting
business have I on the Thursdays. The
wench is in a shop draper."</p>

<p>"How shall I mouth where she is?
With Wright?"</p>

<p>"In shop Breach she is." He spoke
this in English: "So long."</p>

<p>In that language also did Mrs. Jenkins
answer him: "Now we shan't be long."</p>

<p>Narrowing his eyes and crooking his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<i>p</i>  85]</span>knees, Evan stood before Mary. "Like
to find out more would I," he said.
"Guess did the old female that I had
seen the adfertissment."</p>

<p>"Blockhead you are to bare your
mind," Mary admonished him.</p>

<p>"Why for you call me blockhead when
there's no blockhead to be?"</p>

<p>"Sorry am I, dear heart. But do you
hurry to marry me. You know that things
are so and so. The month has shown
nothing."</p>

<p>"Shut your head, or I'll change my
think altogether."</p>

<p>The next week Evan called at the dairy
shop again.</p>

<p>"How was the people?" he cried on
the threshold.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins opened the window which
was at the back of her, and called out:
"The boy from Wales is here, Dai."</p>

<p>Stooping as he moved through the way
of the door, Dai greeted Evan civilly:
"How was you this day?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<i>p</i>  86]</span>"Quite grand," Evan answered.</p>

<p>"What capel do you go?"</p>

<p>"Walham Green, dear man."</p>

<p>"Good preach there was by the Respected
Eynon Daviss the last Sabbath
morning, shall I ask? Eloquent is
Eynon."</p>

<p>"In the night do I go."</p>

<p>"Solemn serious, go you ought in the
mornings."</p>

<p>"Proper is your saying," Evan agreed.
"Perform I would if I could."</p>

<p>"Biggish is your round, perhaps?" said
Dai.</p>

<p>"Iss-iss. No-no." Evan was confused.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of your work. Crafty
is your manner."</p>

<p>Evan had not anything to say.</p>

<p>"Fortune there is in milk," said Dai.
"Study you the size of her. Little she is.
Heavy will be my loss. The rent is only
fifteen bob a week. And thirty gallons
and more do I do. Broke is my health,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<i>p</i>  87]</span>
and Dai laid the palms of his hands on
his belly and groaned.</p>

<p>"Here he is to visit his wench," said
Mrs. Jenkins.</p>

<p>"You're not married now just?" asked
Dai.</p>

<p>"Better in his pockets trousers is a male
for a woman," said Mrs. Jenkins.</p>

<p>"Comforting in your pockets trousers is
a woman," Dai cried.</p>

<p>"Clap your throat," said Mrs. Jenkins.
"Redness you bring to my skin."</p>

<p>Evan retired and considered.</p>

<p>"Tempting is the business," he told
Mary. "Fancy do I to know more of her.
Come must I still once yet."</p>

<p>"Be not slothful," Mary pleaded. "Already
I feel pains, and quickly the months
pass."</p>

<p>Then Evan charged her to watch over
the shop, and to take a count of the people
who went into it. So Mary walked in
the street. Mrs. Jenkins saw her and imagined
her purpose, and after she had proved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<i>p</i>  88]</span>her, she and Dai formed a plot whereby
many little children and young youths and
girls came into the shop. Mary numbered
every one, but the number that she gave
Evan was three times higher than the
proper number. The man was pleased, and
he spoke out to Dai. "Tell me the price
of the shop," he said.</p>

<p>"Improved has the health," replied
Dai. "And not selling I don't think
am I."</p>

<p>"Pity that is. Great offer I have."</p>

<p>"Smother your cry. Taken a shop too
have I in Petersham. Rachel will look
after this."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins spoke to her husband with
a low voice: "Witless you are. Let him
speak figures."</p>

<p>"As you want if you like then," said
Dai.</p>

<p>"A puzzle you demand this one minute,"
Evan murmured. "Thirty pounds
would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Light is your head," Dai cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<i>p</i>  89]</span>"More than thirty gallons and a pram.
Eighty I want for the shop and stock."</p>

<p>"I stop," Evan pronounced. "Thirty-five
can I give. No more and no less."</p>

<p>"Cute bargainer you are. Generous am
I to give back five pounds for luck cash
on spot. Much besides is my counter
trade."</p>

<p>"Bring me papers for my eyes to see,"
said Evan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins rebuked Evan: "Hoity-toity!
Not Welsh you are. Old English
boy."</p>

<p>"Tut-tut, Rachel fach," said Dai.
"Right you are, and right and wrong is
Evan Roberts. Books I should have.
Trust I give and trust I take. I have no
guile."</p>

<p>"How answer you to thirty-seven?"
asked Evan. "No more we've got, drop
dead and blind."</p>

<p>He went away and related all to
Mary.</p>

<p>"Lose the shop you will," Mary warned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<i>p</i>  90]</span>him. "And that's remorseful you'll
be."</p>

<p>"Like this and that is the feeling," said
Evan.</p>

<p>"Go to him," Mary counseled, "and
say you will pay forty-five."</p>

<p>"No-no, foolish that is."</p>

<p>They two conferred with each other, and
Mary gave to Evan all her money, which
was almost twenty pounds; and Evan
said to Dai: "I am not doubtful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak what is in you," Dai urged
quickly.</p>

<p>"Test your shop will I for eight weeks
as manager. I give you twenty down as
earnest and twenty-five at the finish of
the weeks if I buy her."</p>

<p>Dai and Rachel weighed that which
Evan had proposed. The woman said:
"A lawyer will do this"; the man said:
"Splendid is the bargain and costly and
thievish are old lawyers."</p>

<p>In this sort Dai answered Evan: "Do
as you say. But I shall not give money
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<i>p</i>  91]</span>for your work. Act you honestly by me.
Did not mam carry me next my brother,
who is a big preacher? Lend you will I
a bed, and a dish or two and a plate, and
a knife to eat food."</p>

<p>At this Mary's joy was abounding.
"Put you up the banns," she said.</p>

<p>"Lots of days there is. Wait until I've
bought the place."</p>

<p>Mary tightened her inner garments and
loosened her outer garments, and every
evening she came to the shop to prepare
food for Evan, to make his bed, and to
minister to him as a woman.</p>

<p>Now the daily custom at the shop was
twelve gallons of milk, and the tea packets
and flour bags which were on shelves were
empty. Evan's anger was awful. He upbraided
Mary, and he prayed to be shown
how to worst Dai. His prayer was respected:
at the end of the second week
he gave Dai two pounds more than he had
given him the week before.</p>

<p>"Brisk is trade," said Dai.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<i>p</i>  92]</span>"I took into stock flour, tea, and four
tins of job biscuits," replied Evan. "Am
I not your servant?"</p>

<p>"Well done, good and faithful servant."</p>

<p>It was so that Evan bought more than
he would sell, and each week he held a
little money by fraud; and matches also
and bundles of firewood and soap did he
buy in Dai's name.</p>

<p>In the middle of the eighth week Dai
came down to the shop.</p>

<p>"How goes it?" he asked in English.</p>

<p>"Fine, man. Fine." Changing his language,
Evan said: "Keep her will I, and
give you the money as I pledged. Take
you the sum and sign you the paper
bach."</p>

<p>Having acted accordingly, Dai cast his
gaze on the shelves and on the floor, and
he walked about judging aloud the value
of what he saw: "Tea, three-pound-ten;
biscuits, four-six; flour, four-five; firewood,
five shillings; matches, one-ten; soap,
one pound. Bring you these to Petersham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<i>p</i>  93]</span>
Put you them with the bed and the dishes
I kindly lent you."</p>

<p>"For sure me, fulfil my pledge will I,"
Evan said.</p>

<p>He assembled Dai's belongings and
placed them in a cart which he had borrowed;
and on the back of the cart he
hung a Chinese lantern which had in it a
lighted candle. When he arrived at Dai's
house, he cried: "Here is your ownings.
Unload you them."</p>

<p>Dai examined the inside of the cart.
"Mistake there is, Evan. Where's the
stock?"</p>

<p>"Did I not pay you for your stock and
shop? Forgetful you are."</p>

<p>Dai's wrath was such that neither could
he blaspheme God nor invoke His help.
Removing the slabber which was gathered
in his beard and at his mouth, he shouted:
"Put police on you will I."</p>

<p>"Away must I now," said Evan.
"Come, take your bed."</p>

<p>"Not touch anything will I. Rachel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<i>p</i>  94]</span>witness his roguery. Steal he does from
the religious."</p>

<p>Evan drove off, and presently he became
uneasy of the evil that might befall
him were Dai and Rachel to lay their hands
on him; he led his horse into the unfamiliar
and hard and steep road which
goes up to the Star and Garter, and which
therefrom falls into Richmond town. At
what time he was at the top he heard the
sound of Dai and Rachel running to him,
each screaming upon him to stop. Rachel
seized the bridle of the horse, and Dai tried
to climb over the back of the cart. Evan
bent forward and beat the woman with
his whip, and she leaped aside. But Dai
did not release his clutch, and because the
lantern swayed before his face he flung it
into the cart.</p>

<p>Evan did not hear any more voices, and
misdeeming that he had got the better of
his enemies, he turned, and, lo, the bed
was in a yellow flame. He strengthened
his legs and stretched out his thin upper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<i>p</i>  95]</span>lip, and pulled at the reins, saying: "Wo,
now." But the animal thrust up its head
and on a sudden galloped downwards.
At the railing which divides two roads it
was hindered, and Evan was thrown upon
the ground. Men came forward to lift him,
and he was dead.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<i>p</i>  96]</span></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<i>p</i>  97]</span></p>

<h2>FOR BETTER</h2>


<p>At the time it was said of him "There's
a boy that gets on he is," Enoch Harries
was given Gwen the daughter of the
builder Dan Thomas. On the first Sunday
after her marriage the people of Kingsend
Welsh Tabernacle crowded about Gwen,
asking her: "How like you the bed,
Messes Harries fach?" "Enoch has
opened a shop butcher then?" "Any
signs of a baban bach yet?" "Managed to
get up quickly you did the day?" Gwen
answered in the manner the questions were
asked, seriously or jestingly. She considered
these sayings, and the cause of her
uneasiness was not a puzzle to her; and
she got to despise the man whom she had
married, and whose skin was like parched
leather, and to repel his impotent embraces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<i>p</i>  100]</span>Withal she gave Enoch pleasure. She
clothed herself with costly garments,
adorned her person with rings and ornaments,
and she modeled her hair in the
way of a bob-wig. Enoch gave in to her
in all things; he took her among Welsh
master builders, drapers, grocers, dairymen,
into their homes and such places as
they assembled in; and his pride in his
wife was nearly as great as his pride
in the twenty plate-glass windows of his
shop.</p>

<p>In her vanity Gwen exalted her estate.</p>

<p>"I hate living over the shop," she said.
"It's so common. Let's take a house away
from here."</p>

<p>"Good that I am on the premizes,"
Enoch replied in Welsh. "Hap go wrong
will affairs if I leave."</p>

<p>"We can't ask any one decent here.
Only commercials," Gwen said. With a
show of care for her husband's welfare,
she added: "Working too hard is my boy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<i>p</i>  101]</span>bach. And very splendid you should be."</p>

<p>Her design was fulfilled, and she and
Enoch came to dwell in Thornton East,
in a house near Richmond Park, and on
the gate before the house, and on the door
of the house, she put the name Windsor.
From that hour she valued herself high.
She had the words Mrs. G. Enos-Harries
printed on cards, and she did not speak of
Enoch's trade in the hearing of anybody.
She gave over conversing in Welsh, and
would give no answer when spoken to in
that tongue. She devised means continually
to lift herself in the esteem of
her neighbors, acting as she thought they
acted: she had a man-servant and four
maid-servants, and she instructed them to
address her as the madam and Enoch as
the master; she had a gong struck before
meals and a bell rung during meals; the
furniture in her rooms was as numerous
as that in the windows of a shop; she went
to the parish church on Sundays; she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<i>p</i>  102]</span>made feasts. But her life was bitter:
tradespeople ate at her table and her neighbors
disregarded her.</p>

<p>Enoch mollified her moaning with:
"Never mind. I could buy the whole
street up. I'll have you a motor-car. Fine
it will be with an advert on the front
engine."</p>

<p>Still slighted, Gwen smoothed her misery
with deeds. She declared she was a Liberal,
and she frequented Thornton Vale
English Congregational Chapel. She gave
ten guineas to the rebuilding fund, put
a carpet on the floor of the pastor's
parlor, sang at brotherhood gatherings,
and entertained the pastor and his
wife.</p>

<p>Wherefore her charity was discoursed
thus: "Now when Peter spoke of a light
that shines&mdash;shines, mark you&mdash;he was
thinking of such ladies as Mrs. G. Enos-Harries.
Not forgetting Mr. G. Enos-Harries."</p>

<p>"I'm going to build you a vestry,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<i>p</i>  103]</span>
Gwen said to the pastor. "I'll organize a
sale of work to begin with."</p>

<p>The vestry was set up, and Gwen bethought
of one who should be charged with
the opening ceremony of it, and to her
mind came Ben Lloyd, whose repute was
great among the London Welsh, and to
whose house in Twickenham she rode in
her car. Ben's wife answered her sharply:
"He's awfully busy. And I know he
won't see visitors."</p>

<p>"But won't you tell him? It will do
him such a lot of good. You know what a
stronghold of Toryism this place is."</p>

<p>A voice from an inner room cried:
"Who is to see me?"</p>

<p>"Come this way," said Mrs. Lloyd.</p>

<p>Ben, sitting at a table with writing paper
and a Bible before him, rose.</p>

<p>"Messes Enos-Harries," he said, "long
since I met you. No odds if I mouth
Welsh? There's a language, dear me.
This will not interest you in the least.
Put your ambarelo in the cornel, Messes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<i>p</i>  104]</span>
Enos-Harries, and your backhead in a
chair. Making a lecture am I."</p>

<p>Gwen told him the errand upon which
she was bent, and while they two drank
tea, Ben said: "Sing you a song, Messes
Enos-Harries. Not forgotten have I your
singing in Queen's Hall on the Day of
David the Saint. Inspire me wonderfully
you did with the speech. I've been sad
too, but you are a wedded female. Sing
you now then. Push your cup and saucer
under the chair."</p>

<p>"No-no, not in tone am I," Gwen
feigned.</p>

<p>"How about a Welsh hymn? Come in
will I at the repeats."</p>

<p>"Messes Lloyd will sing the piano?"</p>

<p>"Go must she about her duties. She's
a handless poor dab."</p>

<p>Gwen played and sang.</p>

<p>"Solemn pretty hymns have we," said
Ben. "Are we not large?" He moved
and stood under a picture which hung on
the wall&mdash;his knees touching and his feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<i>p</i>  105]</span>apart&mdash;and the picture was that of Cromwell.
"My friends say I am Cromwell and
Milton rolled into one. The Great Father
gave me a child and He took him back to
the Palace. Religious am I. Want I do
to live my life in the hills and valleys of
Wales: listening to the anthem of creation,
and searching for Him under the bark of
the tree. And there I shall wait for the
sound of the last trumpet."</p>

<p>"A poet you are." Gwen was astonished.</p>

<p>"You are a poetess, for sure me," Ben
said. He leaned over her. "Sparkling are
your eyes. Deep brown are they&mdash;brown
as the nut in the paws of the squirrel. Be
you a bard and write about boys Cymru.
Tell how they succeed in big London."</p>

<p>"I will try," said Gwen.</p>

<p>"Like you are and me. Think you do
as I think."</p>

<p>"Know you for long I would," said
Gwen.</p>

<p>"For ever," cried Ben. "But wedded
you are. Read you a bit of the lecture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<i>p</i>  106]</span>will I." Having ended his reading and
having sobbed over and praised that which
he had read, Ben uttered: "Certain you
come again. Come you and eat supper
when the wife is not at home."</p>

<p>Gwen quaked as she went to her car,
and she sought a person who professed to
tell fortunes, and whom she made to say:
"A gentleman is in love with you. And
he loves you for your brain. He is not
your husband. He is more to you than
your husband. I hear his silver voice holding
spellbound hundreds of people; I see
his majestic forehead and his auburn locks
and the strands of his silken mustache."</p>

<p>Those words made Gwen very happy,
and she deceived herself that they were
true. She composed verses and gave them
to Ben.</p>

<p>"Not right to Nature is this," said Ben.
"The mother is wrong. How many children
you have, Messes Enos-Harries?"</p>

<p>"Not one. The husband is weak and he
is older much than I."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<i>p</i>  107]</span>"The Father has kept His most beautiful
gift from you. Pity that is." Tears
gushed from Ben's eyes. "If the marriage-maker
had brought us together, children
we would have jeweled with your eyes
and crowned with your hair."</p>

<p>"And your intellect," said Gwen. "You
will be the greatest Welshman."</p>

<p>"Whisper will I now. A drag is the
wife. Happy you are with the husband."</p>

<p>"Why for you speak like that?"</p>

<p>"And for why we are not married?"
Ben took Gwen in his arms and he kissed
her and drew her body nigh to him; and
in a little while he opened the door
sharply and rebuked his wife that she
waited thereat.</p>

<p>Daily did Gwen praise and laud Ben to
her husband. "There is no one in the
world like him," she said. "He will get
very far."</p>

<p>"Bring Mistar Lloyd to Windsor for
me to know him quite well," said Enoch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<i>p</i>  108]</span>"I will ask him," Gwen replied without
faltering.</p>

<p>"Benefit myself I will."</p>

<p>Early every Thursday afternoon Ben
arrived at Windsor, and at the coming
home from his shop of Enoch, Ben always
said: "Messes Enos-Harries has been singing
the piano. Like the trilling of God's
feathered choir is her music."</p>

<p>Though Ben and Gwen were left at
peace they could not satisfy nor crush
their lust.</p>

<p>Before three years were over, Ben had
obtained great fame. "He ought to be
in Parliament and give up preaching entirely,"
some said; and Enoch and Gwen
were partakers of his glory.</p>

<p>Then Gwen told him that she had conceived,
whereof Ben counseled her to go
into her husband's bed.</p>

<p>"That I have not the stomach to do,"
the woman complained.</p>

<p>"As you say, dear heart," said Ben.
"Cancer has the wife. Perish soon she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<i>p</i>  109]</span>must. Ease our path and lie with your
lout."</p>

<p>Presently Gwen bore a child; and Enoch
her husband looked at it and said: "Going
up is Ben Lloyd. Solid am I as the
counter."</p>

<p>Gwen related her fears to Ben, who contrived
to make Enoch a member of the
London County Council. Enoch rejoiced:
summoning the congregation of Thornton
Vale to be witnesses of his gift of a Bible
cushion to the chapel.</p>

<p>As joy came to him, so grief fell upon
his wife. "After all," Ben wrote to her,
"you belong to him. You have been
joined together in the holiest and sacredest
matrimony. Monumental responsibilities
have been thrust on me by my people.
I did not seek for them, but it is my duty
to bear them. Pray that I shall use God's
hoe with understanding and wisdom. There
is a talk of putting me up for Parliament.
Others will have a chanse of electing a real
religious man. I must not be tempted by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<i>p</i>  110]</span>you again. Well, good-by, Gwen, may He
keep you unspotted from the world. Ships
that pass in the night."</p>

<p>Enoch was plagued, and he followed Ben
to chapel meetings, eisteddfodau, Cymrodorion
and St. David's Day gatherings,
always speaking in this fashion: "Cast
under is the girl fach you do not visit
her. Improved has her singing."</p>

<p>Because Ben was careless of his call,
his wrath heated and he said to him:
"Growing is the baban."</p>

<p>"How's trade?" Ben remarked. "Do
you estimate for Government contracts?"</p>

<p>"Not thought have I."</p>

<p>"Just hinted. A word I can put in."</p>

<p>"Red is the head of the baban."</p>

<p>"Two black heads make red," observed
Ben.</p>

<p>"And his name is Benjamin."</p>

<p>"As you speak. Farewell for to-day.
How would you like to put up for a Welsh
constituency?"</p>

<p>"Not deserving am I of anything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<i>p</i>  111]</span>
Happy would I and the wife be to see you
in the House."</p>

<p>But Ben's promise was fruitless; and
Enoch bewailed: "A serpent flew into my
house."</p>

<p>He ordered Gwen to go to Ben.</p>

<p>"Recall to him this and that," he said.
"A very good advert an M.P. would be
for the business. Be you dressed like a
lady. Take a fur coat on appro from the
shop."</p>

<p>Often thereafter he bade his wife to take
such a message. But Gwen had overcome
her distress and she strew abroad her
charms; for no man could now suffice her.
So she always departed to one of her
lovers and came back with fables on her
tongue.</p>

<p>"What can you expect of the Welsh?"
cried Enoch in his wrath. "He hasn't
paid for the goods he got on tick from the
shop. County court him will I. He ate
my food. The unrighteous ate the food
of the righteous. And he was bad with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<i>p</i>  112]</span>you. Did I not watch? No good is the
assistant that lets the customer go away
with not a much obliged."</p>

<p>The portion of the Bible that Enoch
read that night was this: "I have decked
my bed with coverings of tapestry, with
carved works, with fine linen of Egypt....
Come, let us take our fill of love
until the morning: let us solace ourselves
with love. For the goodman is not at
home, he is gone on a long journey. He
hath&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's lovely," said Gwen.</p>

<p>"Tapestry from my shop," Enoch expounded.
"And Irish linen. And busy
was the draper in Kingsend."</p>

<p>Gwen pretended to be asleep.</p>

<p>"He is the father. That will learn him
to keep his promise. The wicked man!"</p>

<p>Unknown to her husband Gwen stood
before Ben; and at the sight of her Ben
longed to wanton with her. Gwen
stretched out her arms to be clear of
him and to speak to him; her speech was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<i>p</i>  113]</span>stopped with kisses and her breasts swelled
out. Again she found pleasure in Ben's
strength.</p>

<p>Then she spoke of her husband's
hatred.</p>

<p>"Like a Welshman every spit he is,"
said Ben. "And a black."</p>

<p>But his naughtiness oppressed him for
many days and he intrigued; and it came
to pass that Enoch was asked to contest
a Welsh constituency, and Enoch immediately
let fall his anger for Ben.</p>

<p>"Celebrate this we shall with a reception
in the Town Hall," he announced.
"You, Gwen fach, will wear the chikest
Paris model we can find. Ben's kindness
is more than I expected. Much that I
have I owe to him."</p>

<p>"Even your son," said Gwen.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<i>p</i>  114]</span></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<i>p</i>  115]</span></p>

<h2>TREASURE AND TROUBLE</h2>


<p>On a day in a dry summer Sheremiah's
wife Catrin drove her cows to drink at
the pistil which is in the field of a certain
man. Hearing of that which she had
done, the man commanded his son:
"Awful is the frog to open my gate.
Put you the dog and bitch on her.
Teach her will I."</p>

<p>It was so; and Sheremiah complained:
"Why for is my spring barren? In every
field should water be."</p>

<p>"Say, little husband, what is in your
think?" asked Catrin.</p>

<p>"Stupid is your head," Sheremiah answered,
"not to know what I throw out.
Going am I to search for a wet farm
fach."</p>

<p>Sheremiah journeyed several ways, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<i>p</i>  118]</span>always he journeyed in secret; and he
could not find what he wanted. Tailor
Club Foot came to sit on his table to
sew together garments for him and his
two sons. The tailor said: "Farm very
pretty is Rhydwen. Farm splendid is the
farm fach."</p>

<p>"And speak like that you do, Club
Foot," said Sheremiah.</p>

<p>"Iss-iss," the tailor mumbled.</p>

<p>"Not wanting an old farm do I,"
Sheremiah cried. "But speak to goodness
where the place is. Near you are,
calf bach, about affairs."</p>

<p>The tailor answered that Rhydwen is
in the hollow of the hill which arises from
Capel Sion to the moor.</p>

<p>In the morning Sheremiah rode forth
on his colt, and he said to Shan Rhydwen:
"Boy of a pigger am I, whatever."</p>

<p>"Dirt-dirt, man," Shan cried; "no fat
pigs have I, look you."</p>

<p>"Mournful that is. Mouthings have I
heard about grand pigs Tyhen. No odds,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<i>p</i>  119]</span>wench. Farewell for this minute, female
Tyhen."</p>

<p>"Pigger from where you are?" Shan
asked.</p>

<p>"From Pencader the horse has carried
me. Carry a preacher he did the last
Monday."</p>

<p>"Weary you are, stranger. Give hay
to your horse, and rest you and take you
a little cup of tea."</p>

<p>"Happy am I to do that. Thirsty is
the backhead of my neck."</p>

<p>Sheremiah praised the Big Man for tea,
bread, butter, and cheese, and while he
ate and drank he put artful questions to
Shan. In the evening he said to Catrin:
"Quite tidy is Rhydwen. Is she not one
hundred acres? And if there is not water
in every field, is there not in four?"</p>

<p>He hastened to the owner of Rhydwen
and made this utterance: "Farmer very
ordinary is your sister Shan. Shamed was
I to examine your land."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised," answered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<i>p</i>  120]</span>the owner. "Speak hard must I to the
trollop."</p>

<p>"Not handy are women," said Sheremiah.
"Sell him to me the poor-place.
Three-fourths of the cost I give in yellow
money and one-fourth by-and-by in three
years."</p>

<p>Having taken over Rhydwen, Sheremiah
in due season sold much of his corn
and hay, some of his cattle, and many
such movable things as were in his house
or employed in tillage; and he and Catrin
came to abide in Rhydwen; and they arrived
with horses in carts, cows, a bull
and oxen, and their sons, Aben and Dan.
As they passed Capel Sion, people who
were gathered at the roadside to judge
them remarked how that Aben was blind
in his left eye and that Dan's shoulders
were as high as his ears.</p>

<p>At the finish of a round of time Sheremiah
hired out his sons and all that they
earned he took away from them; and he
and Catrin toiled to recover Rhydwen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<i>p</i>  121]</span>from its slovenry. After he had paid all
that he owed for the place, and after
Catrin had died of dropsy, he called his
sons home.</p>

<p>Thereon he thrived. He was over all
on the floor of Sion, even those in the Big
Seat. Men in debt and many widow-women
sought him to free them, and in
freeing them he made compacts to his
advantage. Thus he came to have
more cattle than Rhydwen could hold,
and he bought Penlan, the farm of eighty
acres which goes up from Rhydwen to the
edge of the moor, and beyond.</p>

<p>In quiet seasons he and Aben and Dan
dug ditches on the land of Rhydwen; "so
that," he said, "my creatures shall not
perish of thirst."</p>

<p>Of a sudden a sickness struck him, and
in the hush which is sometimes before
death, he summoned to him his sons.
"Off away am I to the Palace," he said.</p>

<p>"Large will be the shout of joy among
the angels," Aben told him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<i>p</i>  122]</span>"And much weeping there will be in
Sion," said Dan. "Speak you a little
verse for a funeral preach."</p>

<p>"Cease you your babblings, now, indeed,"
Sheremiah demanded. "Born first
you were, Aben, and you get Rhydwen.
And you, Dan, Penlan."</p>

<p>"Father bach," Aben cried, "not right
that you leave more to me than Dan."</p>

<p>"Crow you do like a cuckoo," Dan admonished
his brother. "Wise you are,
father. Big already is your giving to me."</p>

<p>Aben looked at the window and he
beheld a corpse candle moving outward
through the way of the gate. "Religious
you lived, father Sheremiah, and religious
you put on a White Shirt." Then Aben
spoke of the sight he had seen.</p>

<p>The old man opened his lips, counseling:
"Hish, hish, boys. Break you
trenches in Penlan, Dan. Poor bad are
farms without water. More than everything
is water." He died, and his sons
washed him and clothed him in a White<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<i>p</i>  123]</span>
Shirt of the dead, and clipped off his long
beard, which ceasing to grow, shall not
entwine his legs and feet and his arms and
hands on the Day of Rising; and they
bowed their heads in Sion for the full
year.</p>

<p>Dan and Aben lived in harmony. They
were not as brothers, but as strangers;
neighborly and at peace. They married
wives, by whom they had children, and
they sat in the Big Seat in Sion. They
mowed their hay and reaped their corn at
separate periods, so that one could help
the other; if one needed the loan of anything
he would borrow it from his brother;
if one's heifer strayed into the pasture of
the other, the other would say: "The Big
Man will make the old grass grow." On
the Sabbath they and their children walked
as in procession to Sion.</p>

<p>In accordance with his father's word,
Dan dug ditches in Penlan; and against
the barnyard&mdash;which is at the forehead of
his house&mdash;water sprang up, and he caused
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<i>p</i>  124]</span>it to run over his water-wheel into his
pond.</p>

<p>Now there fell upon this part of Cardiganshire
a season of exceeding drought.
The face of the earth was as the face of
a cancerous man. There was no water in
any of the ditches of Rhydwen and none
in those of Penlan. But the spring which
Dan had found continued to yield, and
from it Aben's wife took away water in
pitchers and buckets; and to the pond
Aben brought his animals.</p>

<p>One day Aben spoke to Dan in this
wise: "Serious sure, an old bother is
this."</p>

<p>"Iss-iss," replied Dan. "Good is the
Big Man to allow us water bach."</p>

<p>"How speech you if I said: 'Unfasten
your pond and let him flow into my
ditches'?"</p>

<p>"The land will suck him before he goes
far," Dan answered.</p>

<p>Aben departed; and he considered: "Did
not Penlan belong to Sheremiah? Travel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<i>p</i>  125]</span>under would the water and hap spout up
in my close. Nice that would be. Nasty
is the behavior of Dan and there's sly is
the job."</p>

<p>To Dan he said: "Open your pond,
man, and let the water come into the
ditches which father Sheremiah broke."</p>

<p>Dan would not do as Aben desired,
wherefore Aben informed against him
in Sion, crying: "Little Big Man, know
you not what a Turk is the fox? One eye
bach I have, but you have two, and can
see all his wickedness. Make you him pay
the cost." He raised his voice so high
that the congregation could not discern
the meaning thereof, and it shouted as one
person: "Wo, now, boy Sheremiah!
What is the matter, say you?"</p>

<p>The anger which Aben nourished against
Dan waxed hot. Rain came, and it did
not abate, and the man plotted mischief
to his brother's damage. In heavy darkness
he cut the halters which held Dan's
cows and horses to their stalls and drove
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<i>p</i>  126]</span>the animals into the road. He also
poisoned pond Penlan, and a sheep died
before it could be killed and eaten.</p>

<p>Dan wept very sore. "Take you the
old water," he said. "Fat is my sorrow."</p>

<p>"Not religious you are," Aben censured
him. "All the water is mine."</p>

<p>"Useful he is to me," Dan replied.
"Like would I that he turns my wheel as
he goes to you."</p>

<p>"Clap your mouth," answered Aben.</p>

<p>"Not as much as will go through the leg
of a smoking pipe shall you have."</p>

<p>In Sion Aben told the Big Man of all
the benefits which he had conferred upon
Dan.</p>

<p>Men and women encouraged his fury;
some said this: "An old paddy is Dan
to rob your water. Ach y fi"; and some
said this: "A dirty ass is the mule." His
fierce wrath was not allayed albeit Dan
turned the course of the water away from
his pond, and on his knees and at his labor
asked God that peace might come.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<i>p</i>  127]</span>"Bury the water," Aben ordered, "and
fill in the ditch, Satan."</p>

<p>"That will I do speedily," Dan answered
in his timidity. "Do you give me
an hour fach, for is not the sowing at
hand?" Aben would not hearken unto
his brother. He deliberated with a
lawyer, and Dan was made to dig a ditch
straightway from the spring to the close
of Rhydwen, and he put pipes in the
bottom of the ditch, and these pipes he
covered with gravel and earth.</p>

<p>So as Dan did not sow, he had nothing
to reap; and people mocked him in this
fashion: "Come we will and gather in your
harvest, Dan bach." He held his tongue,
because he had nothing to say. His affliction
pressed upon him so heavily that
he would not be consoled and he hanged
himself on a tree; and his body was
taken down at the time of the morning
stars.</p>

<p>A man ran to Rhydwen and related to
Aben the manner of Dan's death. Aben
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<i>p</i>  128]</span>went into a field and sat as one astonished
until the light of day paled. Then
he arose, shook himself, and set to number
the ears of wheat which were in his field.</p>

<p>God grants prayers gladly. In the moment
that Death was aiming at him a
missile of down, Hughes-Jones prayed:
"Bad I've been. Don't let me fall into
the Fiery Pool. Give me a brief while
and a grand one I'll be for the religion."
A shaft of fire came out of the mouth of
the Lord and the shaft stood in the way of
the missile, consuming it utterly; "so,"
said the Lord, "are his offenses forgotten."</p>

<p>"Is it a light thing," asked Paul, "to
defy the Law?"</p>

<p>"God is merciful," said Moses.</p>

<p>"Is the Kingdom for such as pray conveniently?"</p>

<p>"This," Moses reproved Paul, "is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<i>p</i>  132]</span>written in a book: 'The Lord shall judge
His people.'"</p>

<p>Yet Paul continued to dispute, the
Prophets gathering near him for entertainment;
and the company did not
break up until God, as is the custom in
Heaven when salvation is wrought, proclaimed
a period of rejoicing.</p>

<p>Wherefore Heaven's windows, the
number of which is more than that of
blades of grass in the biggest hayfield,
were lit as with a flame; and Heman and
his youths touched their instruments with
fingers and hammers and the singing
angels lifted their voices in song; and
angels in the likeness of young girls
brewed tea in urns and angels in the likeness
of old women baked pleasant breads
in the heavenly ovens. Out of Hell there
arose two mountains, which established
themselves one over the other on the floor
of Heaven, and the height of the mountains
was the depth of Hell; and you
could not see the sides of the mountains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<i>p</i>  133]</span>for the vast multitude of sinners thereon,
and you could not see the sinners for the
live coals to which they were held, and you
could not see the burning coals for the
radiance of the pulpit which was set on
the furthermost peak of the mountain,
and you could not see the pulpit&mdash;from
toe to head it was of pure gold&mdash;for the
shining countenance of Isaiah; and as
Isaiah preached, blood issued out of the
ends of his fingers from the violence with
which he smote his Bible, and his single
voice was louder than the lamentations
of the damned.</p>

<p>As the Lord had enjoined, the inhabitants
of Heaven rejoiced: eating and
drinking, weeping and crying hosanna.</p>

<p>But Paul would not joy over that which
the Lord had done, and soon he sought
Him, and finding Him said: "A certain
Roman noble labored his horses to their
death in a chariot race before C&aelig;sar: was
he worthy of C&aelig;sar's reward?"</p>

<p>"The noble is on the mountain-side,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<i>p</i>  134]</span>
God answered, "and his horses are in my
chariots."</p>

<p>"One bears witness to his own iniquity,
and you bid us feast and you say 'He
shall have remembrance of me.'"</p>

<p>"Is there room in Heaven for a false
witness?" asked God.</p>

<p>Again did Paul seek God. "My Lord,"
he entreated, "what manner of man is
this that confesses his faults?"</p>

<p>"You will provoke my wrath," said God.
"Go and be merry."</p>

<p>Paul's face being well turned, God
moved backward into the Record Office,
and of the Clerk of the Records He demanded:
"Who is he that prayed unto
me?"</p>

<p>"William Hughes-Jones," replied the
Clerk.</p>

<p>"Has the Forgiving Angel blotted out
his sins?"</p>

<p>"For that I have fixed a long space of
time"; and the Clerk showed God eleven
heavy books, on the outside of each of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<i>p</i>  135]</span>which was written: "William Hughes-Jones,
One and All Drapery Store,
Hammersmith. His sins"; and God
examined the books and was pleased, and
He cried: "Rejoice fourfold"; and if
Isaiah's roar was higher than the wailings
of the perished it was now more awful
than the roar of a hundred bullocks in
a slaughter-house, and if Isaiah's countenance
shone more than anything in
Heaven, it was now like the eye of the
sun.</p>

<p>"Of what nation is he?" the Lord
inquired of the Clerk.</p>

<p>"The Welsh; the Welsh Nonconformists."</p>

<p>"Put before me their good deeds."</p>

<p>"There is none. William Hughes-Jones
is the first of them that has prayed.
Are not the builders making a chamber
for the accounts of their disobedience?"</p>

<p>Immediately God thundered: the earth
trembled and the stars shivered and fled
from their courses and struck against one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<i>p</i>  136]</span>another; and God stood on the brim of the
universe and stretched out a hand and a
portion of a star fell into it, and that is
the portion which He hurled into the
garden of Hughes-Jones's house. On a
sudden the revels ceased: the bread of the
feast was stone and the tea water, and the
songs of the angels were hushed, and the
strings of the harps and viols were withered,
and the hammers were dough, and
the mountains sank into Hell, and behold
Satan in the pulpit which was an iron
cage.</p>

<p>The Prophets hurried into the Judgment
Hall with questions, and lo God was
in a cloud, and He spoke out of the
cloud.</p>

<p>"I am angry," He said, "that Welsh
Nonconformists have not heard my name.
Who are the Welsh Nonconformists?"
The Prophets were silent, and God
mourned: "My Word is the earth and I
peopled the earth with my spittle; and I
appointed my Prophets to watch over my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<i>p</i>  137]</span>people, and the watchers slept and my children
strayed."</p>

<p>Thus too said the Lord: "That hour
I devour my children who have forsaken
me, that hour I shall devour my
Prophets."</p>

<p>"May be there is one righteous among
us?" said Moses.</p>

<p>"You have all erred."</p>

<p>"May be there is one righteous among
the Nonconformists," said Moses; "will
the just God destroy him?"</p>

<p>"The one righteous is humbled, and I
have warned him to keep my commandments."</p>

<p>"The sown seed brought forth a
prayer," Moses pleaded; "will not the
just God wait for the harvest?"</p>

<p>"My Lord is just," Paul announced.
"They who gather wickedness shall not
escape the judgment, nor shall the blind
instructor be held blameless."</p>

<p>Moreover Paul said: "The Welsh Nonconformists
have been informed of you as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<i>p</i>  138]</span>is proved by the man who confessed his
transgressions. It is a good thing for me
that I am not of the Prophets."</p>

<p>"I'll be your comfort, Paul," the
Prophets murmured, "that you have done
this to our hurt." Abasing themselves,
they tore their mantles and howled; and
God, piteous of their howlings, was constrained
to say: "Bring me the prayers
of these people and I will forget your
remissness."</p>

<p>The Prophets ran hither and thither,
wailing: "Woe. Woe. Woe."</p>

<p>Sore that they behaved with such
scant respect, Paul herded them into the
Council Room. "Is it seemly," he rebuked
them, "that the Prophets of God
act like madmen?"</p>

<p>"Our lot is awful," said they.</p>

<p>"The lot of the backslider is justifiably
awful," was Paul's rejoinder. "You have
prophesied too diligently of your own
glory."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<i>p</i>  139]</span>"You are learned in the Law, Paul,"
said Moses. "Make us waywise."</p>

<p>"Send abroad a messenger to preach
damnation to sinners," answered Paul.
"For Heaven," added he, "is the knowledge
of Hell."</p>

<p>So it came to pass. From the hem of
Heaven's Highway an angel flew into
Wales; and the angel, having judged by
his sight and his hearing, returned to the
Council Room and testified to the godliness
of the Welsh Nonconformists. "As
difficult for me," he vowed, "to write
the feathers of my wings as the sum of
their daily prayers."</p>

<p>"None has reached the Record Office,"
said Paul.</p>

<p>"They are always engaged in this
bright business," the angel declared, "and
praising the Lord. And the number of
the people is many and Heaven will need
be enlarged for their coming."</p>

<p>"Of a surety they pray?" asked Paul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<i>p</i>  140]</span>"Of a surety. And as they pray they
quake terribly."</p>

<p>"The Romans prayed hardly," said
Paul. "But they prayed to other
gods."</p>

<p>"Wherever you stand on their land,"
asserted the angel, "you see a temple."</p>

<p>"I exceedingly fear," Paul remarked,
"that another Lord has dominion over
them."</p>

<p>The Prophets were alarmed, and they
sent a company of angels over the earth
and a company under the earth; and the
angels came back; one company said: "We
searched the swampy marges and saw
neither a god nor a heaven nor any
prayer," and the other company said:
"We probed the lofty emptiness and we
did not touch a god or a heaven or any
prayer."</p>

<p>Paul was distressed and he reported his
misgivings to God, and God upbraided
the Prophets for their sloth. "Is there
no one who can do this for me?" He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<i>p</i>  141]</span>cried. "Are all the cunning men in Hell?
Shall I make all Heaven drink the dregs
of my fury? Burnish your rusted armor.
Depart into Hell and cry out: 'Is there
one here who knows the Welsh Nonconformists?'
Choose the most crafty and
release him and lead him here."</p>

<p>Lots were cast and it fell to Moses to
descend into Hell; and he stood at the
well, the water of which is harder than
crystal, and he cried out; and of the
many that professed he chose Saint David,
whom he brought up to God.</p>

<p>"Visit your people," said God to the
Saint, "and bring me their prayers."</p>

<p>"Why should I be called?"</p>

<p>"It is my will. My Prophets have
failed me, and if it is not done they shall
be destroyed."</p>

<p>David laughed. "From Hell comes a
savior of the Prophets. In the middle of
my discourse at the Judgment Seat the
Prophets stooped upon me. 'To Hell with
him,' they screamed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<i>p</i>  142]</span>"Perform faithfully," said the Lord,
"and you shall remain in Paradise."</p>

<p>"My Lord is gracious! I was a Prophet
and the living believe that I am with the
saints. I will retire."</p>

<p>"Perform faithfully and you shall be of
my Prophets."</p>

<p>Then God took away David's body and
nailed it upon a wall, and He put wings
on the shoulders of his soul; and David
darted through a cloud and landed on
earth, and having looked at the filthiness
of the Nonconformists in Wales he withdrew
to London. But however actively
he tried he could not find a man of God
nor the destination of the fearful prayers
of Welsh preachers, grocers, drapers, milkmen,
lawyers, and politicians.</p>

<p>Loth to go to Hell and put to a nonplus,
David built a nest in a tree in Richmond
Park, and he paused therein to consider
which way to proceed. One day he was
disturbed by the singing and preaching of
a Welsh soldier who had taken shelter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<i>p</i>  143]</span>from rain under the tree. David came
down from his nest, and when the mouth
of the man was most open, he plunged
into the fellow's body. Henceforward in
whatsoever place the soldier was there also
was David; and the soldier carried him to
a clothier's shop in Putney, the sign of
the shop being written in this fashion:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">J. Parker Lewis.</span>
The Little (Gents. Mercer) Wonder.

Crossing the threshold, the soldier
shouted: "How are you?"</p>

<p>The clothier, whose skin was as hide
which had been scorched in a tanner's yard,
bent over the counter. "Man bach," he
exclaimed, "glad am I to see you. Pray
will I now that you are all Zer Garnett."
His thanksgiving finished, he said: "Wanting
a suit you do."</p>

<p>"Yes, and no," replied the soldier.
"Cheap she must be if yes."</p>

<p>"You need one for certain. Shabby you
are."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<i>p</i>  144]</span>"This is a friendly call. To a low-class
shop must a poor tommy go."</p>

<p>"Do you then not be cheated by an
English swindler." The clothier raised his
thin voice: "Kate, here's a strange boy."</p>

<p>A pretty young woman, in spite of her
snaggled teeth, frisked into the room like
a wanton lamb. Her brown hair was
drawn carelessly over her head, and her
flesh was packed but loosely.</p>

<p>"Serious me," she cried, "Llew Eevans!
Llew bach, how are you? Very big has the
army made you and strong."</p>

<p>"Not changed you are."</p>

<p>"No. The last time you came was to
see the rabbit."</p>

<p>"Dear me, yes. Have you still got
her?"</p>

<p>"She's in the belly long ago," said the
clothier.</p>

<p>"I have another in her stead," said Kate.
"A splendid one. Would you like to
fondle her?"</p>

<p>"Why, yez," answered the soldier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<i>p</i>  145]</span>"Drat the old animal," cried the clothier.
"Too much care you give her, Kate.
Seven looks has the deacon from Capel
King's Cross had of her and he hasn't
bought her yet."</p>

<p>As he spoke the clothier heaped garments
on the counter.</p>

<p>"Put out your arms," he ordered Kate,
"and take the suits to a room for Llew
to try on."</p>

<p>Kate obeyed, and Llew hymning
"Moriah" took her round the waist and
embraced her, and the woman, hungering
for love, gladly gave herself up. Soon
attired in a black frock coat, a black waistcoat,
and black trousers, Llew stepped into
the shop.</p>

<p>"A champion is the rabbit," he said;
"and very tame."</p>

<p>"If meat doesn't come down," said the
clothier, "in the belly she'll be as well."</p>

<p>"Let me know before you slay her.
Perhaps I buy her. I will study her
again."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<i>p</i>  146]</span>The clothier gazed upon Llew. "Tidy
fit," he said.</p>

<p>"A bargain you give me."</p>

<p>"Why for you talk like that?" the
clothier protested. "No profit can I make
on a Cymro. As per invoice is the cost.
And a latest style bowler hat I throw in."</p>

<p>Peering through Llew's body, Saint
David saw that the dealer dealt treacherously,
and that the money which he got for
the garments was two pounds over that
which was proper.</p>

<p>Llew walked away whistling. "A
simple fellow is the black," he said to himself.
"Three soverens was bad."</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day&mdash;that
day being the Sabbath&mdash;the soldier worshiped
in Capel Kingsend; and betwixt
the sermon and the benediction, the
preacher delivered this speech: "Very
happy am I to see so many warriors here
once more. We sacrificed for them quite
a lot, and if they have any Christianity
left in them they will not forget what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<i>p</i>  147]</span>
Capel Kingsend has done and will repay
same with interest. Happier still we are
to welcome Mister Hughes-Jones to the
Big Seat. In the valley of the shadow
has Mister Hughes-Jones been. Earnestly
we prayed for our dear religious leader.
To-morrow at seven we shall hold a prayer
meeting for his cure. At seven at night.
Will everybody remember? On Monday&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at
seven at night a prayer
meeting for Mister Hughes-Jones will be
held in Capel Kingsend. The duty of
every one is to attend. Will you please
say something now, zer?"</p>

<p>Hughes-Jones rose from the arm-chair
which is under the pulpit, and thrust out
his bristled chin and rested his palms on
the communion table; and he said not one
word.</p>

<p>"Mister Hughes-Jones," the preacher
urged.</p>

<p>"I am too full of grace," said Hughes-Jones;
he spoke quickly, as one who is
on the verge of tears, and his big nostrils
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<i>p</i>  148]</span>widened and narrowed as those of one
who is short of breath.</p>

<p>"The congregation, zer, expects&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well-well, I've had a glimpse of the
better land and with a clear conscience I
could go there, only the Great Father has
more for me to do here. A miracle happened
to me. In the thick of my sickness
a meetority dropped outside the bedroom.
The mistress fainted slap bang. 'If
this is my summons,' I said, 'I am
ready.' A narrow squeak that was. I
will now sit and pray for you one and
all."</p>

<p>In the morning Llew went to the One
and All and in English&mdash;that is the tongue
of the high Welsh&mdash;did he address
Hughes-Jones.</p>

<p>"I've come to start, zer," he said.</p>

<p>"Why wassn't you in the chapel yezterday?"</p>

<p>"I wass there, zer."</p>

<p>"Ho-ho. For me there are two people
in the chapel&mdash;me and Him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<i>p</i>  149]</span>"Yez, indeed. Shall I gommence
now?"</p>

<p>"Gommence what?"</p>

<p>"My crib what I leave to join up."</p>

<p>"Things have changed. There has been
a war on, mister. They are all smart
young ladies here now. And it is not
right to sack them and shove them on the
streets."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't answer back, or I'll have you
chucked from the premizes and locked up.
Much gratitude you show for all I did for
the soders."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, zer."</p>

<p>"We too did our bits at home. Slaved
like horses. Me and the two sons. And
they had to do work of national importance.
Disgraceful I call it in a free country."</p>

<p>"I would be much obliged, zer, if you
would take me on."</p>

<p>"You left on your own accord, didn't
you? I never take back a hand that leave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<i>p</i>  150]</span>on their own. Why don't you be patriotic
and rejoin and finish up the Huns?"</p>

<p>Bowed down, the soldier made himself
drunk, and the drink enlivened his dismettled
heart; and in the evening he stole
into the loft which is above the Big Seat
of Capel Kingsend, purposing to disturb
the praying men with loud curses.</p>

<p>But Llew slept, and while he slept the
words of the praying men came through
the ceiling like the pieces of a child's jigsaw
puzzle; some floated sluggishly and
fell upon the wall and the roof, and some
because of their little strength did not reach
above the floor; and none went through the
roof. Saint David closed his hands on
many, and there was no soundness in them,
and they became as though they were
nothing. He formed a bag of the soldier's
handkerchief, and he filled it with
the words, but as he drew to the edges
they crumbled into less than dust.</p>

<p>He pondered; and he made a sack out
of cobwebs, and when the sack could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<i>p</i>  151]</span>contain any more words, he wove a lid of
cobwebs over the mouth of it. Jealous
that no mishap should befall his treasure,
he mounted a low, slow-moving cloud, and
folding his wings rode up to the Gate of
the Highway.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<i>p</i>  152]</span></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<i>p</i>  153]</span></p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h2>JOSEPH'S HOUSE</h2>


<p>A woman named Madlen, who lived in
Penlan&mdash;the crumbling mud walls of which
are in a nook of the narrow lane that rises
from the valley of Bern&mdash;was concerned
about the future state of her son Joseph.
Men who judged themselves worthy to
counsel her gave her such counsels as these:
"Blower bellows for the smith," "Cobblar
clox," "Booboo for crows."</p>

<p>Madlen flattered her counselors, though
none spoke that which was pleasing unto
her.</p>

<p>"Cobblar clox, ach y fy," she cried to
herself. "Wan is the lad bach with decline.
And unbecoming to his Nuncle
Essec that he follows low tasks."</p>

<p>Moreover, people, look you at John
Lewis. Study his marble gravestone in
the burial ground of Capel Sion: "His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<i>p</i>  156]</span>name is John Newton-Lewis; Paris House,
London, his address. From his big shop
in Putney, Home they brought him by
railway." Genteel are shops for boys who
are consumptive. Always dry are their
coats and feet, and they have white cuffs
on their wrists and chains on their waistcoats.
Not blight nor disease nor frost
can ruin their sellings. And every minute
their fingers grabble in the purses of
nobles.</p>

<p>So Madlen thought, and having acted
in accordance with her design, she took
her son to the other side of Avon Bern,
that is to Capel Mount Moriah, over which
Essec her husband's brother lorded; and
him she addressed decorously, as one does
address a ruler of the capel.</p>

<p>"Your help I seek," she said.</p>

<p>"Poor is the reward of the Big
Preacher's son in this part," Essec announced.
"A lot of atheists they are."</p>

<p>"Not pleading I have not the rent am
I," said Madlen. "How if I prentice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<i>p</i>  157]</span>
Joseph to a shop draper. Has he any
odds?"</p>

<p>"Proper that you seek," replied Essec.
"Seekers we all are. Sit you. No room
there is for Joseph now I am selling
Penlan."</p>

<p>"Like that is the plan of your head?"
Madlen murmured, concealing her dread.</p>

<p>"Seven of pounds of rent is small. Sell
at eighty I must."</p>

<p>"Wait for Joseph to prosper. Buy
then he will. Buy for your mam you
will, Joseph?"</p>

<p>"Sorry I cannot change my think,"
Essec declared.</p>

<p>"Hard is my lot; no male have I to
ease my burden."</p>

<p>"A weighty responsibility my brother
put on me," said Essec. "'Dying with
old decline I am,' the brother mouthed.
'Fruitful is the soil. Watch Madlen keeps
her fruitful.' But I am generous. Eight
shall be the rent. Are you not the wife of
my flesh?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<i>p</i>  158]</span>After she had wiped away her tears,
"Be kind," said Madlen, "and wisdom it
to Joseph."</p>

<p>"The last evening in the seiet I commanded
the congregation to give the Big
Man's photograph a larger hire," said
Essec. "A few of my proverbs I will
now spout." He spat his spittle and
bundling his beard blew the residue of his
nose therein; and he chanted: "Remember
Essec Pugh, whose right foot is tied into
a club knot. Here's the club to kick sinners
as my perished brother tried to kick
the Bad Satan from the inside of his female
Madlen with his club of his baston.
Some preachers search over the Word.
Some preachers search in the Word. But
search under the Word does preacher
Capel Moriah. What's the light I find?
A stutterer was Moses. As the middle of
a butter cask were the knees of Paul. A
splotch like a red cabbage leaf was on the
cheek of Solomon. By the signs shall the
saints be known. 'Preacher Club Foot,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<i>p</i>  159]</span>come forward to tell about Moriah,' the
Big Man will say. Mean scamps, remember
Essec Pugh, for I shall remember you
the Day of Rising."</p>

<p>It came to be that on a morning in the
last month of his thirteenth year Joseph
was bidden to stand at the side of the
cow which Madlen was milking and to give
an ear to these commandments: "The serpent
is in the bottom of the glass. The
hand on the tavern window is the hand of
Satan. On the Sabbath eve get one penny
for two ha'pennies for the plate collection.
Put money in the handkerchief corner.
Say to persons you are a nephew of Respected
Essec Pugh and you will have
credit. Pick the white sixpence from the
floor and give her to the mishtir; she will
have fallen from his pocket trowis."</p>

<p>Then Joseph turned, and carrying his
yellow tin box, he climbed into the craggy
moorland path which takes you to the
tramping road. By the pump of Tavarn
Ffos he rested until Shim Carrier came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<i>p</i>  160]</span>thereby; and while Shim's horse drank of
barley water, Joseph stepped into the
wagon; and at the end of the passage
Shim showed him the business of getting
a ticket and that of going into and coming
down from a railway carriage.</p>

<p>In that manner did Joseph go to the
drapery shop of Rees Jones in Carmarthen;
and at the beginning he was
instructed in the keeping and the selling
of such wares as reels of cotton, needles,
pins, bootlaces, mending wool, buttons, and
such like&mdash;all those things which together
are known as haberdashery. He marked
how this and that were done, and in what
sort to fashion his visage and frame his
phrases to this or that woman. His oncoming
was rapid. He could measure, cut,
and wrap in a parcel twelve yards of
brown or white calico quicker than any
one in the shop, and he understood by rote
the folds of linen tablecloths and bedsheets;
and in the town this was said of him:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<i>p</i>  161]</span>"Shopmen quite ordinary can sell what a
customer wants; Pugh Rees Jones can sell
what nobody wants."</p>

<p>The first year passed happily, and the
second year; and in the third Joseph was
stirred to go forward.</p>

<p>"What use to stop here all the life?"
he asked himself. "Better to go off."</p>

<p>He put his belongings in his box and
went to Swansea.</p>

<p>"Very busy emporium I am in," were
the words he sent to Madlen. "And the
wage is twenty pounds."</p>

<p>Madlen rejoiced at her labor and sang:
"Ten acres of land, and a cow-house with
three stalls and a stall for the new calf, and
a pigsty, and a house for my bones and a
barn for my hay and straw, and a loft
for my hens: why should men pray for
more?" She ambled to Moriah, diverting
passers-by with boastful tales of Joseph,
and loosened her imaginings to the Respected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<i>p</i>  162]</span>"Pounds without number he is earning,"
she cried. "Rich he'll be. Swells
are youths shop."</p>

<p>"Gifts from the tip of my tongue fell
on him," said Essec. "Religious were my
gifts."</p>

<p>"Iss, indeed, the brother of the male
husband."</p>

<p>"Now you can afford nine of pounds
for the place. Rich he is and richer he
will be. Pounds without number he
has."</p>

<p>Madlen made a record of Essec's
scheme for Joseph; and she said also:
"Proud I'll be to shout that my son bach
bought Penlan."</p>

<p>"Setting aside money am I," Joseph
speedily answered.</p>

<p>Again ambition aroused him. "Footling
is he that is content with Zwanssee. Next
half-holiday skurshon I'll crib in Cardiff."</p>

<p>Joseph gained his desire, and the
chronicle of his doings he sent to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<i>p</i>  163]</span>mother. "Twenty-five, living-in, and
spiffs on remnants are the wages," he
said. "In the flannelette department I
am and I have not been fined once. Lot
of English I hear, and we call ladies
madam that the wedded nor the unwedded
are insulted. Boys harmless are the eight
that sleep by me. Examine Nuncle of the
price of Penlan."</p>

<p>"I will wag my tongue craftily and
slowly," Madlen vowed as she crossed her
brother-in-law's threshold.</p>

<p>"I Shire Pembroke land is cheap," she
said darkly.</p>

<p>"Look you for a farm there," said
Essec. "Pelted with offers am I for Penlan.
Ninety I shall have. Poverty makes
me sell very soon."</p>

<p>"As he says."</p>

<p>"Pretty tight is Joseph not to buy her.
No care has he for his mam."</p>

<p>"Stiffish are affairs with him, poor
dab."</p>

<p>Madlen reported to Joseph that which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<i>p</i>  164]</span>
Essec had said, and she added: "Awful
to leave the land of your father. And
auction the cows. Even the red cow that
is a champion for milk. Where shall I
go? The House of the Poor. Horrid that
your mam must go to the House of the
Poor."</p>

<p>Joseph sat on his bed, writing: "Taken
ten pounds from the post I have which
leaves three shillings. Give Nuncle the
ten as earnest of my intention."</p>

<p>Nine years after that day on which he
had gone to Carmarthen Joseph said in
his heart: "London shops for experience";
and he caused a frock coat to be sewn together,
and he bought a silk hat and an
umbrella, and at the spring cribbing he
walked into a shop in the West End of
London, asking: "Can I see the engager,
pleaze?" The engager came to him and
Joseph spoke out: "I have all-round experience.
Flannelettes three years in
Niclass, Cardiff, and left on my own accord.
Kept the colored dresses in Tomos,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<i>p</i>  165]</span>
Zwanssee. And served through. Apprentized
in Reez Jones Carmarthen for three
years. Refs egzellent. Good ztok-keeper
and appearance."</p>

<p>"Start at nine o'clock Monday morning,"
the engager replied. "Thirty pounds
a year and spiffs; to live in. You'll be in
the laces."</p>

<p>"Fashionable this shop is," Joseph wrote
to Madlen, "and I have to be smart and
wear a coat like the preachers, and mustn't
take more than three zwap lines per day
or you have the sack. Two white shirts
per week; and the dresses of the showroom
young ladies are a treat. Five pounds enclosed
for Nuncle."</p>

<p>"Believe your mam," Madlen answered:
"don't throw gravel at the windows of the
old English unless they have the fortunes."</p>

<p>In his zeal for his mother's welfare
Joseph was heedless of himself, eating little
of the poor food that was served him,
clothing his body niggardly, and seldom
frequenting public bath-houses; his mind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<i>p</i>  166]</span>spanned his purpose, choosing the fields he
would join to Penlan, counting the number
of cattle that would graze on the land,
planning the slate-tiled house which he
would set up.</p>

<p>"Twenty pounds more must I have,"
he moaned, "for the blaguard Nuncle."</p>

<p>Every day thereafter he stole a little
money from his employers and every night
he made peace with God: "Only twenty-five
is the wage, and spiffs don't count because
of the fines. Don't you let me be
found out, Big Man bach. Will you strike
mam into her grave? And disgrace Respected
Essec Pugh Capel Moriah?"</p>

<p>He did not abate his energies howsoever
hard his disease was wasting and destroying
him. The men who lodged in his
bedroom grew angry with him. "How can
we sleep with your dam coughing?" they
cried. "Why don't you invest in a second-hand
coffin?"</p>

<p>Feared that the women whom he served
would complain that the poison of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<i>p</i>  167]</span>sickness was tainting them and that he
would be sent away, Joseph increased his
pilferings; where he had stolen a shilling
he now stole two shillings; and when he
got five pounds above the sum he needed,
he heaved a deep sigh and said: "Thank
you for your favor, God bach. I will now
go home to heal myself."</p>

<p>Madlen took the money to Essec, coming
back heavy with grief.</p>

<p>"Hoo-hoo," she whined, "the ninety has
bought only the land. Selling the houses
is Essec."</p>

<p>"Wrong there is," said Joseph. "Probe
deeply we must."</p>

<p>From their puzzlings Madlen said:
"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Go and charge swindler Moriah."</p>

<p>"Meddle not with him. Strong he is
with the Lord."</p>

<p>"Teach him will I to pocket my honest
wealth."</p>

<p>Because of his weakness, Joseph did not
go to Moriah; to-day he said: "I will to-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<i>p</i>  168]</span>morrow,"
and to-morrow he said: "Certain
enough I'll go to-morrow."</p>

<p>In the twilight of an afternoon he and
Madlen sat down, gazing about, and speaking
scantily; and the same thought was
with each of them, and this was the
thought: "A tearful prayer will remove
the Big Man from His judgment, but
nothing will remove Essec from his purpose."</p>

<p>"Mam fach," said Joseph, "how will
things be with you?"</p>

<p>"Sorrow not, soul nice," Madlen entreated
her son. "Couple of weeks very
short have I to live."</p>

<p>"As an hour is my space. Who will
stand up for you?"</p>

<p>"Hish, now. Hish-hish, my little
heart."</p>

<p>Madlen sighed; and at the door she made
a great clatter, and the sound of the clatter
was less than the sound of her wailing.</p>

<p>"Mam! Mam!" Joseph shouted.
"Don't you scream. Hap you will soften<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<i>p</i>  169]</span>
Nuncle's heart if you say to him that my
funeral is close."</p>

<p>Madlen put a mourning gown over her
petticoats and a mourning bodice over
her shawls, and she tarried in a field as
long as it would take her to have traveled
to Moriah; and in the heat of the sun she
returned, laughing.</p>

<p>"Mistake, mistake," she cried. "The
houses are ours. No undertanding was in
me. Cross was your Nuncle. 'Terrible if
Joseph is bad with me,' he said. Man
religious and tidy is Essec." Then she
prayed that Joseph would die before her
fault was found out.</p>

<p>Joseph did not know what to do for
his joy. "Well-well, there's better I am
already," he said. He walked over the
land and coveted the land of his neighbors.
"Dwell here for ever I shall," he
cried to Madlen. "A grand house I'll
build&mdash;almost as grand as the houses of
preachers."</p>

<p>In the fifth night he died, and before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<i>p</i>  170]</span>she began to weep, Madlen lifted her voice:
"There's silly, dear people, to covet
houses! Only a smallish bit of house we
want."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<i>p</i>  171]</span></p>

<h2>LIKE BROTHERS</h2>


<p>Silas Bowen hated his brother John, but
when he heard of John's sickness, he reasoned:
"Blackish has been his dealings.
And trickish. Sly also. Odd will affairs
seem if I don't go to him at once."</p>

<p>At the proper hour he closed the door
of his shop. Then he washed his face,
and put beeswax on the dwindling points
of his mustache, and he came out of
Barnes into Thornton East; into High
Road, where is his brother's shop.</p>

<p>"That is you," said John to him.</p>

<p>"How was you, man?" Silas asked.
"Talk the name of the old malady."</p>

<p>"Say what you have to say in English,"
John answered in a little voice. "It is
easier and classier."</p>

<p>That which was spoken was rendered
into English; and John replied: "I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<i>p</i>  174]</span>pleazed to see you. Take the bowler off
your head and don't put her on the
harimonium. The zweat will mark the
wood."</p>

<p>"The love of brothers push me here,"
said Silas. "It is past understanding.
As boyss we learn the same pray-yer.
And we talked the same temperance
dialogue in Capel Zion. I was always the
temperance one. And quite a champion
reziter. The way is round and about, boy
bach, from Zion to the grave."</p>

<p>"Don't speak like that," pleaded John.
"I caught a cold going to the City to get
ztok. I will be healthy by the beginning
of the week."</p>

<p>"Be it so. Yet I am full of your
trouble. Sick you are and how's
trade?"</p>

<p>"Very brisk. I am opening a shop in
Richmond again," John said.</p>

<p>"You're learning me something. Don't
you think too much of that shop; Death is
near and set your mind on the crossing."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<i>p</i>  175]</span>John's lame daughter Ann halted
into the room, and stepped up to the
bed.</p>

<p>"Stand by the door for one minit,
Silas," John cried. "I am having my
chat confidential."</p>

<p>From a book Ann recited the business
of that day; naming each article that had
been sold, and the cost and the profit
thereof.</p>

<p>"How's that with last year?" her
father commanded.</p>

<p>"Two-fifteen below."</p>

<p>"Fool!" John whispered. "You are
a cow, with your gamey leg. You're ruining
the place."</p>

<p>Ann closed the book and put her fountain
pen in the leather case which was
pinned to her blouse, and she spoke this
greeting: "How are you, Nuncle Silas.
It's long since I've seen you." She thrust
out her arched teeth in a smile. "Good-night,
now. You must call and see our
Richmond establishment."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<i>p</i>  176]</span>"Silas," said John, "empty a dose of
the medecyne in a cup for me."</p>

<p>"There's little comfort in medecyne,"
Silas observed. "Not much use is the
stuff if the Lord is calling you home.
Calling you home. Shall I read you a
piece from the Beybile of the Welsh? It
is a great pity you have forgot the language
of your mother."</p>

<p>"I did not hear you," said John.
"Don't you trouble to say it over." He
drank the medicine. "Unfortunate was
the row about the Mermaid Agency. I
was sorry to take it away from you, but
if I hadn't some one else would. We kept
it in the family, Silas."</p>

<p>"I have prayed a lot," said Silas to his
brother, "that me and you are brought together
before the day of the death. Nothing
can break us from being brothers."</p>

<p>"You are very doleful. I shall shift this
little cold."</p>

<p>"Yes-yes, you will. I would be glad
to follow your coffin to Wales and look
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<i>p</i>  177]</span>into the guard's van at stations where
the train stop, but the fare is big and the
shop is without a assistant. Weep until
I am sore all over I shall in Capel Shirland
Road. When did the doctor give
you up?"</p>

<p>"He's a donkey. He doesn't know
nothing. Here he is once per day and
charging for it. And he only brings his
repairs to me."</p>

<p>"The largest charge will be to take you
to your blessed home," said Silas. "The
railway need a lot of money for to carry a
corpse. I feel quite sorrowful. In Heaven
you'll remember that I was at your deathbed."</p>

<p>John did not answer.</p>

<p>"Well-well," said Silas, whispering
loudly, "making his peace with the Big
Man he is"; and he went away, moaning
a funereal hymn tune.</p>

<p>John thought over his plight and was
distressed, and he spoke to God in Welsh:
"Not fitting that you leave the daughter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<i>p</i>  178]</span>fach alone. Short in her leg you made
her. There's a set-back. Her mother
perished; and did I complain? An orphan
will the pitiful wench be. Who will care
for the shop? And the repairing workman?
Steal the leather he will. A fuss will be
about shop Richmond. Paid have I the
rent for one year in advance. Serious will
the loss be. Be not of two thinks. Send
Lisha to breathe breathings into my inside&mdash;in
the belly where the heart is. Forgive
me that I go to the Capel English. Go
there I do for the trade. Generous am I
in the collections. Ask the preacher. Take
some one else to sit in my chair in the
Palace. Amen. Amen and amen." In
his misery he sobbed, and he would not
speak to Ann nor heed her questionings.
At the cold of dawn he thought that
Death was creeping down to him, and he
screamed: "Allow me to live for a year&mdash;two
years&mdash;and a grand communion set
will I give to the Welsh capel in Shirland
Road. Individual cups. Silver-plated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<i>p</i>  179]</span>
Sheffield make. Ann shall send quickly for
the price-list."</p>

<p>His fear was such that he would not
suffer his beard to be combed, nor have
his face covered by a bedsheet; and he
would not stretch himself or turn his face
upwards: in such a manner dead men
lie.</p>

<p>Again came Silas to provoke his brother
to his death.</p>

<p>"Richmond shops are letting like anything,"
he said.</p>

<p>"The place is coming on," replied John.
"I was lucky to get one in King's Row.
She is cheap too."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? There's
a new boot shop in King's Row already.
Next door to the jeweler."</p>

<p>"You are mistook. I have taken
her."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you are cheated. Get
up at once and make a case. Wear an
overcoat and ride in the bus."</p>

<p>But John bade Ann go to Richmond
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[<i>p</i>  180]</span>and to say this and that to the owner of
the house. Ann went and the house was
empty.</p>

<p>A third time Silas came out of Barnes,
bringing with him gifts. These are the
gifts that he offered his brother John: a
tin of lobster, a tin of sardines, a tin of
salmon, and a tin of herrings; and through
each tin, in an unlikely place, he had driven
the point of a gimlet.</p>

<p>"Eat these," he said, "and good they
will do you."</p>

<p>"Much obliged," replied John. "I'll
try a herring with bread and butter
and vinegar to supper. Very much
obliged. It was not my blame that we
quarreled. Others had his eye on the
agency."</p>

<p>"Tish, I did not want the old Mermaid.
You keep her. I got the sole agency for
the Gwendoline."</p>

<p>"How is Gwendolines going?"</p>

<p>"More than I can do to keep ztok of
her. Four dozen gents' laces and three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[<i>p</i>  181]</span>dozen ladies' ditto on the twenty-fifth, and
soon I order another four dozen ladies'
buttons."</p>

<p>John called Ann and to her he said:
"How is Mermaid ztok?"</p>

<p>"We are almost out of nine gents and
four ladies," answered Ann.</p>

<p>"Write Nuncle Silas the order and he'll
drop her in the Zity. Pay your fare one
way will I, Silas."</p>

<p>Silas fled the next day into the Mermaid
warehouse and sought out the manager.
"My brother J. Owen and Co. Thornton
East has sold his last pair of Mermaids,"
he said.</p>

<p>He brought trouble into his eyes and
made his voice to quiver as he told how
that John was dying and how that the
shop was his brother's legacy to him.
"Send you the goods for this order to
my shop in Barnes," he added. "And
all future orders. That will be my headquarters."</p>

<p>He did not go to John's house any more;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<i>p</i>  182]</span>and although John ate of the lobster, the
herrings, and the sardines and was sick, he
did not die. A week expired and a sound
reached him that Silas was selling Mermaid
boots; and he enjoined Ann to test the
truth of that sound.</p>

<p>"It's sure enough, dad," Ann said.</p>

<p>John's fury tingled. He put on him
his clothes and seized a stick, and by the
strength of his passion he moved into
Barnes; and he pitched himself at the
entering in of the shop, and he saw that
Ann's speech was right. He came back;
and he did not eat or drink or rest until
he had removed all that was in his window
and had placed therein no other boots than
the Mermaids; and on each pair he put a
ticket which was truly marked: "Half
cost price." On his door he put this notice:
"This FIRM has no Connection with the
shop in Barnes"; and this notice could be
seen and read whether the door was open
or shut.</p>

<p>After a period people returned to him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[<i>p</i>  183]</span>demanding: "I want a pair of Mermaids,
please"; and inasmuch as he had no more
to sell, they who had dealt with him went
to the shop of his brother.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<i>p</i>  184]</span></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<i>p</i>  185]</span></p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>

<h2>A WIDOW WOMAN</h2>


<p>The Respected Davydd Bern-Davydd
spoke in this sort to the people who were
assembled at the Meeting for Prayer:
"Well-well, know you all the order of
the service. Grand prayers pray last.
Boys ordinary pray middle, and bad
prayers pray first. Boys bach just beginning
also come first. Now, then, after I've
read a bit from the Book of Speeches and
you've sung the hymn I call out, Josi Mali
will report."</p>

<p>Bern-Davydd ceased his reading, and
while the congregation sang, Josi placed
his arms on the sill which is in front of
pews and laid his head thereon.</p>

<p>"Josi Mali, man, come to the Big Seat
and mouth what you think," said Bern-Davydd.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<i>p</i>  188]</span>Josi's mother Mali touched her son,
whispering this counsel: "Put to shame
the last prayer, indeed now, Josi."</p>

<p>By and by Josi lifted his head and stood
on his feet. This is what he said: "Asking
was I if I was religious enough to spout
in the company of the Respected."</p>

<p>"Out of the necks of young youths we
hear pieces that are very sensible," said
Bern-Davydd. "Come you, Josi Mali,
to the saintly Big Seat."</p>

<p>As Josi moved out of his pew, his thick
lips fallen apart and his high cheek bones
scarlet, his mother said: "Keep your eyes
clapped very close, or hap the prayers will
shout that you spoke from a hidden book
like an old parson."</p>

<p>So Josi, who in the fields and on his
bed had exercised prayer in the manner
that one exercises singing, uttered his first
petition in Capel Sion. He told the Big
Man to pardon the weakness of his words,
because the trousers of manhood had not
been long upon him; he named those who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<i>p</i>  189]</span>entered the Tavern and those who ate
bread which had been swollen by barm;
he congratulated God that Bern-Davydd
ruled over Sion.</p>

<p>At what time he was done, Bern-Davydd
cried out: "Amen. Solemn, dear
me, amen. Piece quite tidy of prayer";
and the men of the Big Seat cried: "Piece
quite tidy of prayer."</p>

<p>The quality of Josi's prayers gave much
pleasure in Sion, and it was noised abroad
even in Morfa, from whence a man journeyed,
saying: "Break your hire with your
master and be a servant in my farm.
Wanting a prayer very bad do we in Capel
Salem." Josi immediately asked leave of
God to tell Bern-Davydd that which the
man from Morfa had said. God gave
him leave, wherefore Bern-Davydd, whose
spirit waxed hot, answered: "Boy, boy,
why for did you not kick the she cat on
the backhead?"</p>

<p>Then Josi said to his mother Mali: "A
preacher will I be. Go will I at the finish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<i>p</i>  190]</span>of my servant term to the school for Grammar
in Castellybryn."</p>

<p>"Glad am I to hear you talk," said Mali.
"Serious pity that my belongings are so
few."</p>

<p>"Small is your knowledge of the
Speeches," Josi rebuked his mother.
"How go they: 'Sell all that you have?'
Iss-iss, all, mam fach."</p>

<p>Now Mali lived in Pencoch, which is in
the valley about midway between Shop
Rhys and the Schoolhouse, and she rented
nearly nine acres of the land which is on
the hill above Sion. Beyond the furnishings
of her two-roomed house, she owned
three cows, a heifer, two pigs, and fowls.
She fattened her pigs and sold them, and
she sold also her heifer; and Josi went to
the School of Grammar. Mali labored
hard on the land, and she got therefrom all
that there was to be got; and whatever
that she earned she hid in a hole in the
ground. "Handy is little money," she
murmured, "to pay for lodgings and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<i>p</i>  191]</span>clothes preacher, and the old scamps of
boys who teach him." She lived on potatoes
and buttermilk, and she dressed her
land all the time. People came to remark
of her: "There's no difference between
Mali Pencoch and the mess in her cow-house."</p>

<p>Days, weeks, and months moved slowly;
and years sped. Josi passed from the
School of Grammar to College Carmarthen,
and Mali gave him all the money
that she had, and prayed thus: "Big Man
bach, terrible would affairs be if I perished
before the boy was all right. Let you
me keep my strength that Josi becomes as
large as Bern-Davydd. Amen."</p>

<p>Even so. Josi had a name among Students'
College, and even among ordained
rulers of pulpits; and Mali went about
her duties joyful and glad; it was as if the
Kingdom of the Palace of White Shirts
was within her. While at her labor she
mumbled praises to the Big Man for His
goodness, until an awful thought came to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<i>p</i>  192]</span>her: "Insulting am I to the Large One
bach. Only preachers are holy enough to
stand in their pray. Not stop must I now;
go on my knees will I in the dark."</p>

<p>She did not kneel on her knees for the
stiffness that was in her limbs.</p>

<p>Her joy was increased exceedingly when
Josi was called to minister unto Capel
Beulah in Carmarthen, and she boasted:
"Bigger than Sion is Moriah and of lofts
has not the Temple two?"</p>

<p>"Idle is your babbling," one admonished
her. "Does a calf feed his
mother?"</p>

<p>Josi heard the call. His name grew;
men and women spoke his sayings one to
another, and Beulah could not contain
all the people who would hear his word;
and he wrote a letter to his mother: "God
has given me to wed Mary Ann, the daughter
of Daniel Shop Guildhall. Kill you a
pig and salt him and send to me the meat."</p>

<p>All that Josi asked Mali gave, and more;
she did not abate in any of her toil for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<i>p</i>  193]</span>five years, when a disease laid hold on Josi
and he died. Mali cleaned her face and
her hands in the Big Pistil from which
you draw drinking water, and she brought
forth her black garments and put them
on her; and because of her age she could
not weep. The day before that her son
was to be buried, she went to the house of
her neighbor Sara Eye Glass, and to her
she said: "Wench nice, perished is Josi and
off away am I. Console his widow fach I
must. Tell you me that you will milk my
cow."</p>

<p>Sara turned her seeing eye upon Mali.
"An old woman very mad you are to go
two nines of miles."</p>

<p>"Milk you my cow," said Mali. "And
milk you her dry. Butter from me the
widow fach shall have. And give ladlings
of the hogshead to my pigs and scatter
food for my hens."</p>

<p>She tore a baston from a tree, trimmed
it and blackened it with blacking, and at
noon she set forth to the house of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<i>p</i>  194]</span>daughter-in-law; and she carried in a
basket butter, two dead fowls, potatoes,
carrots, and a white-hearted cabbage, and
she came to Josi's house in the darkness
which is in the morning, and it was so that
she rested on the threshold; and in the
bright light Mary Ann opened the door,
and was astonished. "Mam-in-law," she
said, "there's nasty for you to come like
this. Speak what you want. Sitting there
is not respectable. You are like an old
woman from the country."</p>

<p>"Come am I to sorrow," answered Mali.
"Boy all grand was Josi bach. Look at
him now will I."</p>

<p>"Talking no sense you are," said Mary
Ann. "Why you do not see that the
house is full of muster? Will there not
be many Respecteds at the funeral?"</p>

<p>"Much preaching shall I say?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, iss. But haste about now and
help to prepare food to eat. Slow you
are, female."</p>

<p>Presently mourners came to the house,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<i>p</i>  195]</span>and when each had walked up and gazed
upon the features of the dead, and when
the singers had sung and the Respecteds
had spoken, and while a carpenter
turned screws into the coffin, Mary Ann
said to Mali: "Clear you the dishes now,
and cut bread and spread butter for those
who will return after the funeral. After
all have been served go you home to Pencoch."
She drew a veil over her face and
fell to weeping as she followed the six
men who carried Josi's coffin to the hearse.</p>

<p>Having finished, Mali took her baston
and her empty basket and began her journey.
As she passed over Towy Street&mdash;the
public way which is set with stones&mdash;she
saw that many people were gathered
at the gates of Beulah to witness Mary
Ann's loud lamentations at Josi's grave.</p>

<p>Mali stayed a little time; then she went
on, for the light was dimming. At the
hour she reached Pencoch the mown hay
was dry and the people were gathering it
together. She cried outside the house of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<i>p</i>  196]</span>
Sara Eye Glass: "Large thanks, Sara fach.
Home am I, and like pouring water were
the tears. And there's preaching." She
milked her cows and fed her pigs and her
fowls, and then she stepped up to her bed.
The sounds of dawn aroused her. She
said to herself: "There's sluggish am I.
Dear-dear, rise must I in a haste, for Mary
Ann will need butter to feed the baban
bach that Josi gave her."</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h2>UNANSWERED PRAYERS</h2>


<p>When Winnie Davies was let out of
prison, shame pressed heavily on her feelings;
and though her mother Martha and
her father Tim prayed almost without
ceasing, she did not come home. It was
so that one night Martha watched for her
at a window and Tim prayed for her at
the door of the Tabernacle, and a bomb
fell upon the ground that was between
them, and they were both destroyed.</p>

<p>All the days of their life, Tim and
Martha were poor and meek and religious;
they were cheaper than the value set on
them by their cheapeners. As a reward
for their pious humility, they were appointed
keepers of the Welsh Tabernacle,
which is at Kingsend. At that they took
their belongings into the three rooms that
are below the chapel; and their spirits were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<i>p</i>  200]</span>lifted up marvelously that the Reverend
Eylwin Jones and the deacons of the
Tabernacle had given to them the way of
life.</p>

<p>In this fashion did Tim declare his
blessedness: "Charitable are Welsh to
Welsh. Little Big Man, boys tidy are
boys Capel Tabernacle."</p>

<p>"What if we were old atheists?" cried
Martha.</p>

<p>"Wife fach, don't you send me in a
fright," Tim said.</p>

<p>They two applied themselves to their
tasks: the woman washed the linen and
cleaned the doorsteps and the houses of
her neighbors, the man put posters on
hoardings, trimmed gardens, stood at the
doors of Welsh gatherings. By night they
mustered, sweeping the floor of the chapel,
polishing the wood and brass that were
therein, and beating the cushions and hassocks
which were in the pews of the most
honored of the congregation. Sunday
mornings Tim put a white india-rubber
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<i>p</i>  201]</span>collar under the Adam's apple in his throat,
and Martha covered her long, thin body in
black garments, and drew her few hairs
tightly from her forehead.</p>

<p>Though they clad and comported themselves
soberly Enoch Harries, who, at this
day, was the treasurer and head deacon of
the chapel, spoke up against them to
Eylwin Jones. This is his complaint:
"Careless was Tim in the dispatch department,
delivering the parcel always to the
wrong customers and for why he was
sacked. Good was I to get him the capel.
Careless he is now also. By twilight, dark,
and thick blackness, light electric burns in
Tabernacle. Waste that is. Sound will I
my think. Why cannot the work be done
in the day I don't know."</p>

<p>"You cannot say less," said Eylwin
Jones. "Pay they ought for this, the
irreligious couple. As the English
proverb&mdash;'There's no gratitude in the
poor.'"</p>

<p>"Another serious piece of picking have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<i>p</i>  202]</span>
I," continued Harries. "I saw Tim sticking
on hoarding. 'What, dear me,' I
mumbled between the teeth&mdash;I don't speech
to myself, man, as usual. The Apostles
did, now. They wrote their minds. Benefit
for many if I put down my religious
thinks for a second New Testament.
What say you, Eylwin Jones? Lots of
says very clever I can give you&mdash;'is he
sticking?' A biggish paper was the black
pasting about Walham Green Music Hall.
What do you mean for that? And the
posters for my between season's sale were
waiting to go out."</p>

<p>Rebuked, Tim and Martha left over
sinning: and Tim put Enoch Harries'
posters in places where they should not
have been put, wherefore Enoch smiled
upon him.</p>

<p>"Try will I some further," said Tim by
and by.</p>

<p>"Don't you crave too much," advised
Martha. "The Bad Man craved the pulpit
of the Big Man."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<i>p</i>  203]</span>"Shut your backhead. Out of school
will Winnie be very near now."</p>

<p>"Speak clear."</p>

<p>"Ask Enoch Harries will I to make her
his servant."</p>

<p>"Be modest in your manner," Martha
warned her husband. "Man grand is
Enoch."</p>

<p>"Needing servants hap he does."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, iss; perhaps, no."</p>

<p>"Cute is Winnie," said Tim; "and
quick. Sense she has."</p>

<p>Tim addressed Enoch, and Enoch answered:
"Blabber you do to me, why
for? Send your old female to Mishtress
Harries. Order you her to go quite respectable."</p>

<p>Curtsying before Mrs. Harries, Martha
said: "I am Tim Dafis' wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, really. The person that is in
charge of that funny little Welsh chapel."
Mrs. Harries sat at a table. "Give me
your girl's name, age, and names of previous
employers for references." Having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<i>p</i>  204]</span>written all that Martha said, she remarked:
"We are moving next week to a
large establishment in Thornton East. I
am going to call it Windsor. Of course
the husband and I will go to the English
church. I thought I could take your girl
with me to Windsor."</p>

<p>"The titcher give her an excellent character."</p>

<p>"I'll find that out for myself. Well,
as you are so poor, I'll give her a trial.
I'll pay her five pounds a year and her
keep. I do hope she is ladylike."</p>

<p>Martha told Tim that which Mrs. Harries
had said, and Tim observed: "I will
rejoice in a bit of prayer."</p>

<p>"Iss," Martha agreed. "In the parlor
of the preacher. They go up quicker."</p>

<p>God was requested by Tim to heap
money upon Mrs. Harries, and to give
Winnie the wisdom, understanding, and
obedience which enable one to serve faithfully
those who sit in the first pews in the
chapel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<i>p</i>  205]</span>Now Winnie found favor in the sight
of her mistress, whose personal maid she
was made and whose habits she copied.
She painted her cheeks and dyed her hair
and eyebrows and eyelashes; and she frequented
Thornton Vale English Congregational
Chapel, where now worshiped
Enoch and his wife. Some of the men
who came to Windsor ogled her impudently,
but she did not give herself to
any man. These ogles Mrs. Harries interpreted
truthfully and she whipped up
her jealous rage.</p>

<p>"You're too fast," she chided Winnie.
"Look at your blouse. You might be undressed.
You are a shame to your sex.
One would say you are a Piccadilly street-walker
and they wouldn't be far wrong.
I won't have you making faces at my
visitors. Understand that."</p>

<p>Winnie said: "I don't."</p>

<p>"You must change, miss," Mrs. Harries
went on. "Or you can pack your box and
go on the streets. Must not think because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<i>p</i>  206]</span>you are Welsh you can do as you like
here."</p>

<p>On a sudden Winnie spoke and charged
her mistress with a want of virtue.</p>

<p>"Is that the kind of miss you are!"
Mrs. Harries shouted. "Where did you
get those shoes from?"</p>

<p>"You yourself gave them to me."</p>

<p>"You thief! You know I didn't. They
are far too small for your big feet. Come
along&mdash;let's see what you've got upstairs."</p>

<p>That hour Mrs. Harries summoned a
policeman, and in due time Winnie was
put in prison.</p>

<p>Tim and Martha did not speak to any
one of this that had been done to their
daughter.</p>

<p>"Punished must a thief be," said Tim.
"Bad is the wench."</p>

<p>"Bad is our little daughter," answered
Martha.</p>

<p>Sabbath morning came and she wept.</p>

<p>"Showing your lament you are, old
fool," cried Tim.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<i>p</i>  207]</span>"For sure, no. But the mother am I."</p>

<p>Tim said: "My inside shivers oddly.
Girl fach too young to be in jail."</p>

<p>A fire was set in the preacher's parlor
and the doors of the Tabernacle were
opened. Tim, the Bible in his hands,
stepped up to the pulpit, his eyes closed
in prayer, and as he passed up he stumbled.</p>

<p>Eylwin Jones heard the noise of his fall
and ran into the chapel.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he cried.
"Comic you look on your stomach.
Great one am I for to see jokes."</p>

<p>"An old rod did catch my toe," Tim
explained.</p>

<p>Eylwin changed the cast of his countenance.
"Awful you are," he reproved
Tim. "Suppose that was me. Examine
you the stairs. Now indeed forget a handkerchief
have I for to wipe the flow of the
nose. Order Winnie to give me one of
Enoch Harries. Handkerchiefs white and
smelly he has."</p>

<p>"Ill is Winnie fach," said Martha.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<i>p</i>  208]</span>"Gone she has for brief weeks to
Wales," Tim added.</p>

<p>In the morning Eylwin came to the
Tabernacle.</p>

<p>"Not healthy am I," he said. "Shock
I had yesterday. Fancy I do a rabbit
from Wales for the goiter."</p>

<p>"Tasty are rabbits," Tim uttered.</p>

<p>"Clap up, indeed," said Martha. "Too
young they are to eat and are they not
breeding?"</p>

<p>"Rabbits very young don't breed," remarked
Eylwin.</p>

<p>"They do," Martha avowed. "Sometimes,
iss; sometimes, no. Poison they
are when they breed."</p>

<p>"Not talking properly you are," said
Eylwin. "Why for you palaver about
breeding to the preacher? Cross I will
be."</p>

<p>"Be you quiet now, Martha," said Tim.
"Lock your tongue."</p>

<p>"Send a letter to Winnie for a rabbit;
two rabbits if she is small," ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<i>p</i>  209]</span>
Eylwin. "And not see your faults
will I."</p>

<p>Tim and Martha were perplexed and
communed with each other; and Tim
walked to Wimbledon where he was not
known and so have his errand guessed.
He bought a rabbit and carried it to the
door of the minister's house. "A rabbit
from Winnie fach in Wales," he said.</p>

<p>"Eat her I will before I judge her,"
replied Eylwin; and after he had eaten it
he said: "Quite fair was the animal. Serious
dirty is the capel. As I flap my hand
on the cushion Bible in my eloquence, like
chimney smoke is the dust. Clean you at
once. For are not the anniversary meetings
on the sixth Sabbath? All the rich
Welsh will be there, and Enoch Harries
and the wife of him."</p>

<p>He came often to view Tim and Martha
at their labor.</p>

<p>"Fortunate is your wench to have holiday,"
he said one day. "Hard have
preachers to do in the vineyard."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<i>p</i>  210]</span>"Hear we did this morning," Tim began
to speak.</p>

<p>"In a hurry am I," Eylwin interrupted.
"Fancy I do butter from Wales with one
pinch of salt in him. Tell Winnie to send
butter that is salted."</p>

<p>Martha bought two pounds of butter.</p>

<p>"Mean is his size," Tim grieved.</p>

<p>"Much is his cost," Martha whined.</p>

<p>"Get you one pound of marsherin and
make him one and put him on a wetted
cabbage leaf."</p>

<p>The fifth Sunday dawned.</p>

<p>"Next to-morrow," said Martha, "the
daughter will be home. Go you to the
jail and fetch her, and take you for her a
big hat for old jailers cut the hair very
short."</p>

<p>"No-no," Tim replied. "Better she returns
and speak nothing. With no questions
shall we question her."</p>

<p>Monday opened and closed.</p>

<p>"Mistake is in your count," Martha
hinted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<i>p</i>  211]</span>"Slow scolar am I," said Tim. "Count
will I once more."</p>

<p>"Don't you, boy bach," Martha hastened
to say. "Come she will."</p>

<p>At the dusk of Friday Eylwin Jones, his
goitered chin shivering, ran furiously and
angrily into the Tabernacle. "Ho-ho,"
he cried. "In jail is Winnie. A scampess
is she and a whore. Here's scandal.
Mother and father of a thief in the house
of the capel bach of Jesus Christ. Robbed
Mistress Harries she did. Broke is the
health of the woman nice as a consequent.
She will not be at the anniversary meetings
because the place is contaminated by
you pair. And her husband won't. Five
shillings each they give to the collection.
The capel wants the half soferen. Out you
go. Now at once."</p>

<p>Tim and Martha were sorely troubled
that Winnie would come to the Chapel
House and not finding them, would go
away.</p>

<p>"Loiter will I near by," said Tim.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<i>p</i>  212]</span>"Say we rent a room and peer for her,"
said Martha.</p>

<p>Thereon from dusk to day either Tim or
Martha sat at the window of their room
and watched. The year died and spring
and summer declined into autumn, when
on a moon-lit night men flew in machines
over London and loosened bombs upon the
people thereof.</p>

<p>"Feared am I," said Martha, "that our
daughter is not in the shelter." She
screamed: "Don't stand there like a mule.
Pray, Tim man."</p>

<p>Remembering how that he had prayed,
Tim answered: "Try a prayer will I near
the capel."</p>

<p>So Martha watched at her window and
Tim prayed at the door of the Tabernacle.</p>

<h2>LOST TREASURE</h2>


<p>Here is the tale that is told about Hugh
Evans, who was a commercial traveler in
drapery wares, going forth on his journeys
on Mondays and coming home on
Fridays. The tale tells how on a Friday
night Hugh sat at the table in the kitchen
of his house, which is in Parson's Green.
He had before him coins of gold, silver,
and copper, and also bills of his debts; and
upon each bill he placed certain monies
in accordance with the sum marked thereon.
Having fixed the residue of his coins
and having seen that he held ten pounds,
his mind was filled with such bliss that he
said within himself: "A nice little amount
indeed. Brisk are affairs."</p>

<p>"Millie," he addressed his wife, "look
over them and add them together."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<i>p</i>  216]</span>"Wait till I'm done," was the answer.
"The irons are all hotted up."</p>

<p>Hugh chided her. "You are not interested
in my saving. You don't care. It's
nothing to you. Forward, as I call."</p>

<p>"If I sit down," Millie offered, "I feel
I shall never get up again and the irons
are hotted and what I think is a shame
to waste gas like this the price it is."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so at the first
opportunity? Be quick then. I shan't
allow the cash to lay here."</p>

<p>Duly Millie observed her husband's order,
and what time she proved that which Hugh
had done, she was admonished that she
had spent too much on this and that.</p>

<p>"I'm doing all I can not to be extravagant,"
she whimpered. "I don't buy a
thing for my back." Her short upper lip
curled above her broken teeth and trembled;
she wept.</p>

<p>"But whatever," said Hugh softening
his spirit, "I got ten soferens in hand.
Next quarter less you need and more you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[<i>p</i>  217]</span>have. Less gass and electric. You don't
gobble food so ravishingly in warm
weather. The more I save."</p>

<p>Having exchanged the ten pounds for a
ten-pound note, remorse seized Hugh. "A
son of a mule am I," he said. "Dangerous
is paper as he blows. If he blows!
Bulky are soferens and shillings. If you
lose two, you got the remnants. But they
are showy and tempting." He laid the
note under his pillow and slept, and he
took it with him, secreted on his person,
to Kingsend Chapel, where every Sunday
morning and evening he sang hymns,
bowed under prayer, and entertained his
soul with sermons.</p>

<p>Just before departing on Monday he
gave the note to Millie. "Keep him securely,"
he counseled her. "Tell nobody
we stock so much cash."</p>

<p>Millie put the note between the folds of
a Paisley shawl, which was precious to her
inasmuch as it had been her mother's, and
she wrapped a blanket over the shawl and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<i>p</i>  218]</span>placed it in a cupboard. But on Friday
she could not remember where she had
hidden the note; "never mind," she consoled
herself, "it will occur to me all of a
sudden."</p>

<p>As that night Hugh cast off his silk hat
and his frock coat, he shouted: "Got the
money all tightly?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Millie quickly. "As safe
as in the Bank of England."</p>

<p>"Can't be safer than that. Keep him
close to you and tell no one. Paper money
has funny ways." Hugh then prophesied
that in a year his wealth in a mass would
be fifty pounds.</p>

<p>"With ordinary luck, and I'm sure you
desire it because you're always at it, it
will," Millie agreed.</p>

<p>"No luck about it. No stop to me.
We've nothing to purchase. And you
don't. At home you are, with food and
clothes and a ceyling above you. Kings
don't want many more."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Millie. "No."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<i>p</i>  219]</span>Weeks passed and Millie was concerned
that she could not find the note, tried she
never so hard. At the side of her bed
she entreated to be led to it, and in the
day she often paused and closing her eyes
prayed: "Almighty Father, bring it to
me."</p>

<p>The last Friday of the quarter Hugh
divided his money in lots, and it was that
he had eleven pounds over his debts.
"Eleven soferens now," he cried to his
wife. "That's grand! Makes twenty-one
the first six months of the wedded life."</p>

<p>"It reflects great credit on you," said
Millie, concealing her unhappiness.</p>

<p>"Another eighty and I'd have an
agency. Start a factory, p'raps. There's
John Daniel. He purchases an house.
Ten hands he has working gents' shirts
for him."</p>

<p>Millie turned away her face and demanded
from God strength with which to
acquaint her husband of her misfortune.
What she asked for was granted unto her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<i>p</i>  220]</span>at her husband's amorous moment of the
Sabbath morning.</p>

<p>Hugh's passion deadened, and in his
agony he sweated.</p>

<p>"They're gone! Every soferen," he
cried. "They can't all have gone. The
whole ten." He opened his eyes widely.
"Woe is me. Dear me. Dear me."</p>

<p>Until day dimmed and night grayed did
they two search, neither of them eating and
neither of them discovering the treasure.</p>

<p>Therefore Hugh had not peace nor
quietness. Grief he uttered with his
tongue, arms, and feet, and it was in the
crease of his garments. He sought sympathy
and instruction from those with
whom he traded. "All the steam is gone
out of me," he wailed. One shopkeeper
advised him: "Has it slipped under the
lino?" Another said: "Any mice in the
house? Money has been found in their
holes." The third said: "Sure the wife
hasn't spent it on dress. You know what
ladies are." These hints and more Hugh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<i>p</i>  221]</span>wrote down on paper, and he mused in this
wise: "An old liar is the wench. For
why I wedded the English? Right was
mam fach; senseless they are. Crying she
has lost the yellow gold, the bitch. What
blockhead lost one penny? What is in
the stomach of my purse this one minute?
Three shillings&mdash;soferen&mdash;five pennies&mdash;half
a penny&mdash;ticket railway. Hie backwards
will I on Thursday on the surprise.
No comfort is mine before I peep once
again."</p>

<p>He pried in every drawer and cupboard,
and in the night he arose and inquired
into the clothes his wife had left
off; and he pushed his fingers into the holes
of mice and under the floor coverings, and
groped in the fireplaces; and he put subtle
questions to Millie.</p>

<p>"If you'd done like this in a shop you'd
be sacked without a ref," he said when his
search was over. "We must have him
back. It's a sin to let him go. Reduce
expenses at once."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<i>p</i>  222]</span>Millie disrobed herself by the light of a
street lamp, and she ate little of such
foods as are cheapest, whereat her white
cheeks sunk and there was no more luster
in her brown hair; and her larder was
as though there was a famine in the
country. If she said to Hugh: "Your
boots are leaking," she was told: "Had
I the soferens I would get a pair"; or if
she said: "We haven't a towel in the
place," the reply was: "Find the soferens
and buy one or two."</p>

<p>The more Hugh sorrowed and scrimped,
the more he gained; and word of his
fellows' hardships struck his broad, loose
ears with a pleasant tinkle. While on his
journeys he stayed at common lodging-houses,
and he did not give back to his
employers any of the money which was
allowed him to stay at hotels. Some folk
despised him, some mocked him, and many
nicknamed him "the ten-pound traveler."
To the shopkeeper who hesitated to deal
with him he whined his loss, making it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<i>p</i>  223]</span>greater than it was, and expressing: "The
interest alone is very big."</p>

<p>By such methods he came to possess one
hundred and twenty pounds in two years.
His employers had knowledge of his deeds,
and they summoned him to them and said
to him that because of the drab shabbiness
of his clothes and his dishonest acts they
had appointed another in his stead.</p>

<p>"You started this," he admonished
Millie. "Bring light upon mattar."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" Millie replied.
"Shall I go back to the dressmaking as
I was?"</p>

<p>Hugh was not mollified. By means of
such women man is brought to a penny.
He felt dishonored and wounded. Of the
London Welsh he was the least. Look at
Enos-Harries and Ben Lloyd and Eynon
Davies. There's boys for you. And look
at the black John Daniel, who was a prentice
with him at Carmarthen. Hark him
ordering preacher Kingsend. Watch him
on the platform on the Day of David the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<i>p</i>  224]</span>
Saint. And all, dear me, out of J.D.'s
Ritfit three-and-sixpence gents' tunic
shirts.</p>

<p>He considered a way, of which he spoke
darkly to Millie, lest she might cry out his
intention.</p>

<p>"No use troubling," he said in a changed
manner. "Come West and see the shops."</p>

<p>Westward they two went, pausing at
windows behind which were displayed
costly blouses.</p>

<p>"That's plenty at two guineas," Hugh
said of one.</p>

<p>"It's a Paris model," said Millie.</p>

<p>"Nothing in her. Nothing."</p>

<p>"Not much material, I grant," Millie
observed. "The style is fashionable and
they charge a lot."</p>

<p>"I like to see you in her," said Hugh.
"Take in the points and make her with
an odd length of silk."</p>

<p>When the blouse was finished, Hugh
took it to a man at whose shop trade the
poorest sort of middle-class women, say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<i>p</i>  225]</span>ing:
"I can let you have a line like this at
thirty-five and six a dozen."</p>

<p>"I'll try three twelves," said the man.</p>

<p>Then Hugh went into the City and
fetched up Japanese silk, and lace, and
large white buttons; and Millie sewed with
her might.</p>

<p>Hugh thrived, and his success was noised
among the London Welsh. The preacher
of Kingsend Chapel visited him.</p>

<p>"Not been in the Temple you have,
Mistar Eevanss, almost since you were
spliced," he said. "Don't say the wife
makes you go to the capel of the English."</p>

<p>"Busy am I making money."</p>

<p>"News that is to me, Mistar Eevanss.
Much welcome there is for you with
us."</p>

<p>In four years Hugh had eighteen machines,
at each of which a skilled woman
sat; and he hired young girls to sew
through buttons and hook-and-eyes and to
make button-holes. These women and
girls were under the hand of Millie, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<i>p</i>  226]</span>kept count of their comings and goings
and the work they performed, holding from
their wages the value of the material they
spoilt and of the minutes they were not at
their task. Millie labored faithfully, her
heart being perfect with her husband's.
She and Hugh slept in the kitchen, for all
the other rooms were stockrooms or workrooms;
and the name by which the concern
was called was "The French Model Blouse
Co. Manageress&mdash;Mme. Zetta, the notorious
French Modiste."</p>

<p>Howsoever bitterly people were pressed,
Hugh did not cease to prosper. In riches,
honor, and respect he passed many of the
London Welsh.</p>

<p>For that he could not provide all the
blouses that were requested of him, he
rented a big house. That hour men were
arrived to take thereto his belongings,
Millie said: "I'll throw the Paisley shawl
over my arm. I wouldn't lose it for anything";
and as she moved away the ten-pound
note fell on the ground. "Well, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<i>p</i>  227]</span>never!" she cried in her dismay. "It was
there all the time."</p>

<p>Hugh seized the note from her hand.</p>

<p>"You've the head of a sieve," he said.
Also he lamented: "All these years we
had no interest in him."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<i>p</i>  228]</span></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<i>p</i>  229]</span></p>

<h2>PROFIT AND GLORY</h2>


<p>By serving in shops, by drinking himself
drunk, and by shamming good fortune,
Jacob Griffiths gave testimony to the
miseries and joys of life, and at the age
of fifty-six he fell back in his bed at his
lodging-house in Clapham, suffered, drew
up his crippled knees and died. On the
morrow his brother Simon hastened to the
house; and as he neared the place he
looked up and beheld his sisters Annie and
Jane fach also hurrying thither. Presently
they three saw one another as with a single
eye, wherefore they slackened their pace
and walked with seemliness to the door.
Jacob's body was on a narrow, disordered
bed, and in the state of its deliverance:
its eyes were aghast and its hands were
clenched in deathful pangs.</p>

<p>Then Simon bowed his trunk and lifted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<i>p</i>  232]</span>his silk hat and his umbrella in the manner
of a preacher giving a blessing.</p>

<p>"Of us family it can be claimed," he pronounced,
"that even the Angel do not
break us. We must all cross Jordan.
Some go with boats and bridges. Some
swim. Some bridges charge a toll&mdash;one
penny and two pennies. A toll there is to
cross Jordan."</p>

<p>"He'll be better when he's washed and
laid out proper," remarked the woman of
the lodging-house.</p>

<p>"Let down your apron from your head,"
Simon said to her. "We are mourning
for our brother, the son of the similar
father and mother. You don't think me
insulting if I was alone with the corpse.
I shan't be long at my religious performance.
I am a busy man like you."</p>

<p>The woman having gone, he spoke at
Jacob: "Perished you are now, Shacob.
You have unraveled the tangled skein of
eternal life. Pray I do you will find rest
with the restless of big London. Annie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<i>p</i>  233]</span>and Jane fach, sorrowful you are; wet are
your tears. Go you and drink a nice cup
of tea in the caf&eacute;. Most eloquent I shall
be in a minute and there's hysterics you'll
get. Arrive will I after you. Don't pay
for tea; that will I do."</p>

<p>"Iss, indeed," said Annie. "Off you,
Jane fach. You, Simon, with her, for
fear she is slayed in the street. Sit here
will I and speak to the spirit of Shacob."</p>

<p>"The pant of my breath is not back"&mdash;Jane
fach's voice was shrill. "Did I
not muster on reading the death letter?
Witness the mud sprinkled on my gown."</p>

<p>"Why should you muster, little sister?"
inquired Simon.</p>

<p>"Right that I reach him in respectable
time, was the think inside me," Jane fach
answered. "What other design have I?
Stay here I will. A boy, dear me, for a
joke was Shacob with me. Heaps of gifts
he made me; enough to fill a yellow tin
box."</p>

<p>"Generous he was," Simon said. "Hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<i>p</i>  234]</span>
he parted with all. Full of feeling you
are. But useless that we loll here. No
odds for me; this is my day in the City.
How will your boss treat you, Annie, for
being away without a pass? Angry will
your buyer be, I would be in a temper with
my young ladies. Hie to the office, Jane.
Don't you borrow borrowings from me if
you are sacked."</p>

<p>"You are as sly as the cow that steals
into clover," Annie cried out. She removed
her large hat and set upright the
osprey feathers thereon, puffed out her
hair which was fashioned in a high pile,
and whitened with powder the birth-stain
on her cheek. "They daren't discharge
me. I'd carry the costume trade with me.
Each second you hear, 'Miss Witton-Griffiths,
forward,' and 'Miss Witton-Griffiths,
her heinness is waiting for you.'
In favor am I with the buyer."</p>

<p>"Whisper to me your average takings
per week," Simon craved. "Not repeat
will I."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<i>p</i>  235]</span>After exaggerating her report, Annie
said: "You are going now, then."</p>

<p>Jane fach took from a chair a cup that
had tea in it, a candlestick&mdash;the candle in
which died before Jacob&mdash;and a teapot,
and she sat in the chair. "Oo-oo," she
squeaked. "Sorry am I you are flown."</p>

<p>"Stupid wenches you are," Simon admonished
his sisters. "And curious.
Scandalous you are to pry into the leavings
of the perished dead."</p>

<p>Jane fach, whose shoulders were
crumped and whose nose was as the beak
of a parrot, put forth her head. "The
reins of a flaming chariot can't drag
me from him. Was he not father
to me? Much he handed and more he
promised."</p>

<p>"Great is your avarice," Simon declared.</p>

<p>"Fonder he was of me than any one,"
Annie cried. "The birthdays he presented
me with dresses&mdash;until he was
sacked. While I was cribbing, did he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<i>p</i>  236]</span>not speak well to my buyer? Fitting I
stay with him this day."</p>

<p>"I was his chief friend," said Simon.
"We were closer than brothers. So grand
was he to me that I could howl once more.
Iss, I could preach a funeral sermon on
my brother Shacob."</p>

<p>Jacob's virtues were truly related.
Much had the man done for his younger
brother and sisters; albeit his behavior was
vain, ornamenting his person garishly and
cheaply, and comporting himself foolishly.
Summer by summer he went to Wales and
remained there two weeks; and he gave a
packet of tea or coffee to every widow who
worshiped in the capel, and a feast of tea
and currant bread and carraway-seed cake
to the little children of the capel.</p>

<p>Wheedlers flattered him for gain: "The
watch of a nobleman you carry" and
"The ring would buy a field," said those
about Sion; "Never seen a more exact
fact simily of King George in my life than
you," cried spongers in London public-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<i>p</i>  237]</span>houses.
All grasped whatever gifts they
could and turned from him laughing: "The
watch of the fob is brass"; "No more
worth than a play marble is the ring";
"Old Griffiths is the bloomin' limit." Yet
Jacob had delight in the thought that folk
passed him rich for his apparel and acts.</p>

<p>"Waste of hours very awful is this,"
Simon uttered by and by. He brought
out his order book and a blacklead pencil.
"Take stock will I now and put down."</p>

<p>He searched the pockets of Jacob's garments
and the drawers in the chest, and
knelt on his knees and peered under
Jacob's bed; and all that he found were
trashy clothes and boots. His sisters tore
open the seams of the garments and
spread their fingers in the hollow places,
and they did not find anything.</p>

<p>"Jewellary he had," exclaimed Annie.
"Much was the value of his diamond ring.
'This I will to you,' he said to me. Champion
she would seem on my finger. Half a
hundred guineas was her worth."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<i>p</i>  238]</span>"Where is the watch and chain?" Jane
fach demanded. "Gold they were. Link
like the fingers of feet the chain had.
These I have."</p>

<p>"Lovely were his solitaires," cried
Annie. "They are mine."</p>

<p>"Liar of a bitch," said Jane fach.
"'All is yours,' mouthed Shacob my
brother, who hears me in the Palace."</p>

<p>Simon answered neither yea nor no. He
stepped down to the woman of the house.
"I have a little list here of the things my
brother left in your keeping," he began.
"Number wan, gold watch&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman opened her lips and spoke:
"Godstruth, he didn't have a bean to his
name. Gold watch! I had to call him in
the mornings. What with blacking his
whiskers and being tender on his feet, which
didn't allow of him to run to say the least
of it, I was about pretty early. Else he'd
never get to Ward's at all. And Balham
is a long run from here."</p>

<p>"I will come back and see you later,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<i>p</i>  239]</span>
Simon replied, and he returned to his sisters.
"Hope I do," he said to them.
"You discover his affairs. All belong to
you. Tall was his regard for you two.
Now we will prepare to bury him. Privilege
to bury the dead. Sending the corpse
to the crystal capel. Not wedded are you
like me. Heavy is the keep of three children
and the wife."</p>

<p>"For why could not the fool have saved
for his burying, I don't say?" Annie
cried. "Let the perished perish. That's
equal for all."</p>

<p>"In sense is your speech," Simon
agreed. "Shop fach very neat he might
have if he was like me and you."</p>

<p>"Throwing away money he did," Annie
said. "I helped him three years ago when
he was sacked. Did I not pay for him to
sleep one month in lodgings?"</p>

<p>"I got his frock coat cleaned at cost
price," Jane fach remembered, "and sewed
silk on her fronts. I lent him lendings.
Where are my lendings?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<i>p</i>  240]</span>"A squanderer you were," Simon rebuked
the body. "Tidy sums you spent
in pubs. Booze got you the sack after
twenty years in the same shop. Disgraced
was I to have such a brother as
you, Shacob. Where was your religion,
man? But he has to be buried, little
sisters, or babbling there'll be. Cheap
funeral will suit in Fulham cematary.
Reasonable your share is more than mine,
because the Big Man has trusted me with
sons."</p>

<p>"No sense is in you," Annie shouted.
"Not one coin did he repay me. The
coins he owed me are my share."</p>

<p>"As an infidel you are," said Simon.
"Ach y fy, cheating the grave of custom."</p>

<p>"Leaving am I." Jane fach rose.
"Late is the day."</p>

<p>"Woe is me," Simon wailed. "Like
the old Welsh of Cardigan is your cunning.
Come you this night here to listen to
funeral estimates. Don't you make me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<i>p</i>  241]</span>bawl this in your department, Annie, and
in your office laundry, Jane."</p>

<p>From the street door he journeyed by
himself to Balham, and habiting his face
with grief, he related to Mr. Ward how
Jacob died.</p>

<p>"He passed in my arms," he said;
"very gently&mdash;willingly he gave back the
ghost. A laugh in his face that might be
saying: 'I see Thy wonders, O Lord.'"</p>

<p>"This is very sad," said Mr. Ward.
"If there is anything we can do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You speak as a Christian who goes to
chapel, sir. It's hard to discuss business
now just. But Jacob has told he left a
box in your keep."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Still, I'll make
sure." Mr. Ward went away, and returning,
said: "The only thing he left
here is this old coat which he wore at
squadding in the morning. Of course there
is his salary&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know. I'd give millions
of salaries for my brother back."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<i>p</i>  242]</span>"You are his only relative?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir. No father and mother
had he. An orphan. Quite pathetic. I
will never grin again. Good afternoon,
sir. I hope you'll have a successful summer
sale."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better take his money?"
said Mr. Ward. "We pay quarterly
here."</p>

<p>"Certainly it will save coming again.
But business is business, even in the presence
of the dead."</p>

<p>"It's eighteen pounds. That's twelve
weeks at one-ten."</p>

<p>"Well, if you insist, insist you do.
Prefer I would to have my brother Jacob
back."</p>

<p>Simon put the coat over his arm and
counted the money, and after he had drunk
a little beer and eaten of bread and cheese,
he made deals with a gravedigger and an
undertaker, and the cost for burying
Jacob was eight pounds.</p>

<p>That night he was with his sisters, say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<i>p</i>  243]</span>ing
to them: "Twelve soferens will put
him in the earth. Four soferens per each."</p>

<p>"None can I afford," Jane fach vowed.
"Not paid my pew rent in Capel Charing
Cross have I."</p>

<p>"Easier for me to fly than bring the
cash," said Annie. "Larger is your screw
than me."</p>

<p>Simon smote the ground with his umbrella
and stayed further words. "Give
the soferens, bullocks of Hell fire."</p>

<p>Annie and Jane fach were distressed.
The first said: "The flesh of the swine
shall smell before I do." The second said:
"Hard you are on a bent-back wench."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their murmurs, Simon
hurled at them the spite of his wrath,
reviling them foully and filthily; and the
women got afraid that out of his anger
would come mischief, and each gave as
she was commanded.</p>

<p>The third day Simon and Annie and
Jane fach stood at Jacob's grave; and
Annie and Jane were put to shame that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<i>p</i>  244]</span>
Simon bragged noisily how that he had
caused a name-plate to be made for
Jacob's coffin and a wreath of glass flowers
for the mound of Jacob's grave.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
